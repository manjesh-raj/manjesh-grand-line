"""Merges the vendored ggml-metal shader source into one self-contained
Metal source file and re-generates WhisperMetalShaderSource.swift.

Why this exists (fm/grandline-dictation-whisper-metal-accel): whisper.cpp's
ggml-metal.metal has `#include "ggml-common.h"` and `#include
"ggml-metal-impl.h"` lines that only resolve when the Metal compiler has a
real header search path - which a plain NSString handed to
`MTLDevice.makeLibrary(source:options:)` at runtime never has (no include
path can be attached to a source string). Upstream's own CMake build solves
this with a sed-based text merge for its "embedded library" build mode (see
`ggml/src/ggml-metal/CMakeLists.txt`'s `GGML_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY` branch) -
this script does the same merge, once, at vendor time, then base64-encodes
the result into a generated Swift source file so it ships inside the
compiled binary itself (same convention as `CaptainIcon.swift`'s embedded
PNG - no dependency on SwiftPM resource-bundle packaging, which this app's
`build_native_app.sh` does not copy into the assembled .app at all).

Run this again only when re-syncing whisper.cpp's vendored Metal sources
from upstream (see Vendor/whisper.cpp/README.md's "Re-syncing" section) -
the three input files below are already vendored in this repo, this script
does not fetch anything from the network.
