# Run every self-test suite in the app (GL-19).
#
# This project has no XCTest target - it has ~44 permanent self-test suites,
# each gated behind its own `FM_RUN_<NAME>_TESTS=1` environment variable and
# each exiting the process with 0/1 (see any `*SelfTest.swift` header, or
# AGENTS.md's "Verifying native UI bugs" section, for why that convention
# exists). Until this script existed, running "the tests" meant 44 manual
# invocations, which in practice meant nobody ran the ones they had not
# personally written.
#
# The suite list is discovered from `main.swift` rather than hardcoded here, so
# adding a new suite makes it part of this run automatically and this script
# cannot silently drift out of date.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh              # build, then run every suite
#   ./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --no-build   # skip `swift build`
#   ./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --list       # print the discovered suites and exit
#   ./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --ci         # skip suites that need a real login
#                                           # session (see NEEDS_SESSION below)
#   ./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh FM_RUN_SHIFT_STORE_TESTS FM_RUN_BACKUP_TESTS
#                                           # run only the named suites
#
# The suites are compiled into DEBUG builds only (GL-27): `Package.swift`
# defines `FM_SELFTESTS` for the debug configuration, so `swift build` has every
# suite and `swift build -c release` - what `native/build_native_app.sh`
# assembles the shipped `.app` from - has none of them. That is why this script
# builds and runs `.build/debug/FirstmateCockpit` and must keep doing so; a
# release binary silently runs zero suites and exits 0, which would look exactly
# like a clean run.
#
# The suite list is still discovered by grepping `main.swift` for the flags,
# which works either way: the flags remain plain source text inside the
# `#if FM_SELFTESTS` block.
#
# SAFETY: this runs the app's own binary, which is safe *because* every one of
# these flags is handled before `NSApplication.shared` is ever touched - the
# process runs headless and exits. Do NOT extend this script to launch the app
# itself: every build of this app shares one bundle identity, so a launched
# copy from a worktree can disturb the captain's real running instance. See the
# README's "Never launch a built copy from a worktree" note.
