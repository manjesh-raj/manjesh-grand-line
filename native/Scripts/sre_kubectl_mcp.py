"""SRE Lead's MCP tools: run a read-only kubectl command (or a whole runbook
of them) in the captain's own already-connected terminal tab for this host.

Minimal MCP stdio JSON-RPC server (`initialize`, `notifications/initialized`,
`tools/list`, `tools/call`), standard library only, no pip install. Spawned
as a subprocess of the local `claude` CLI (see `SRELead.swift`).

**`fm/grandline-k8s-context-badge` widened `_ALLOWED_VERBS` to include
`config`, but only its two read-only subcommands** - `get-contexts` and
`current-context` (see `_CONFIG_READONLY_SUBCOMMANDS`) - for a
context/namespace safety badge on host pages (`KubeContextBridge.swift`).
The badge itself never spawns this script or goes through this MCP
server/`claude` layer at all: it injects the two fixed, hardcoded commands
directly via a small sibling of `SRELeadBridge`, the same marker-injection
mechanism, with no AI reasoning involved. This widening exists so `_validate_args`
- the one place read-only enforcement lives, reused by both `kubectl_readonly`
and `run_runbook` - stays the single, carefully reviewed definition of what's
safe to type into the shared terminal, in case SRE Lead's own AI is ever
asked about the current context/namespace too. `config`'s real WRITE forms
(`use-context`, `set-context`, `delete-context`, `rename-context`, `set`,
`unset`, ...) are refused explicitly, not just left to the generic character-
set/smuggled-verb checks that were never designed to know about `config`'s
own subcommand vocabulary.

**`fm/grandline-sre-lead-runbook-execution` added a second tool,
`run_runbook`**, for the captain's conversational "run the API latency spike
runbook" ask. It is deliberately NOT a new capability: it looks a runbook up
by name in `GrandLineDocs/runbooks/` (via `SRE_LEAD_RUNBOOKS_DIR`, set by
`SRELead.setUp` alongside `SRE_LEAD_BRIDGE_DIR`), extracts the kubectl
command lines from its fenced code blocks, and validates *every single one*
through `_validate_args` - the exact same function `kubectl_readonly` itself
calls, not a second or looser check - before running any of them. If even
one line fails validation (not `kubectl` at all, an unparseable line, or a
subcommand/argument outside the allowlist), the whole runbook is refused by
name with the failing step named and explained; nothing is executed. Only
once every line passes does it run them sequentially through
`_execute_via_bridge` (the same shared-terminal mechanism `kubectl_readonly`
already uses) and return each step's result. See `_run_runbook`/
`_validate_runbook_line`/`_extract_command_lines` below.

**`fm/cockpit-sre-lead-shared-terminal` replaced this tool's whole execution
model - read this before touching anything below.** Every earlier version
(five attempts: PRs #70/#71/#72/#73, plus an abandoned PTY investigation) ran
kubectl over a *second*, independent SSH connection to the same bastion,
built from `Host.sshArguments(allHosts:)` plus (depending on the attempt) a
`become_user`/`startup_snippet` escalation. The captain then confirmed a hard
constraint that makes the entire second-connection approach a dead end on the
real "EKS Preprod Bastion" host: its EKS Bastion hop is username/password-
gated *by policy* - no SSH key auth is possible there. A second, independent,
fully-automated SSH connection can never complete that login chain, because
nothing can supply a password that isn't stored anywhere, by design - no
argument-shape fix, stdin-piping trick, or extra hop could ever have worked,
because the premise (a second automated connection can finish the login) was
false from the start. **Do not resurrect a second-connection approach for
this or any other password-gated host** - if a future host needs kubectl
access and also has a password-gated hop, it needs this same shared-terminal
approach, not a variant of the old one.

The fix: never open a second connection at all. Run the kubectl command in
the *same*, already-authenticated interactive terminal tab the captain used
to log all the way into the host by hand - the same idea `Snippet`'s "Run"
action already uses (`TerminalView.send(txt:)`), just machine-initiated. This
script and the Swift app are different processes with no shared memory, so
`SRELeadBridge.swift` (Swift, in the app) and this script talk over a small
file-based request/response protocol in a per-session directory
(`SRE_LEAD_BRIDGE_DIR`, set by `SRELead.setUp`):

  1. This script writes `request-<id>.json` (`{"command": "<kubectl ...>"}`)
     into that directory, atomically (write to a `.tmp` path, then `os.rename`
     into place, so the Swift side never reads a half-written file).
  2. `SRELeadBridge` notices the file, injects `<command>` into the host
     page's one primary interactive tab wrapped with two fresh random
     markers (`echo <start marker>; <command>; echo <end marker>`), polls
     that tab's own terminal buffer for the end marker to appear, extracts
     everything between the two markers as the real output, and writes
     `response-<id>.json` back (`{"ok": true, "output": "..."}` or
     `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}` - e.g. if the tab looked busy, if the
     captain typed into it while the command was running, or on timeout).
  3. This script polls for that response file to appear, reads it, and
     returns it as this tool's result.

Read-only enforcement lives HERE, not in the persona prompt and not in
`SRELeadBridge.swift`: `_ALLOWED_VERBS` is the only set of kubectl subcommands
this tool will ever run, and `_validate_args` rejects anything that isn't a
plain, individually-safe argument - no shell metacharacters, so there is no
way for a flag-smuggled `--dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -` (or
any other `;`/`&&`/`` ` ``/`$()`-based trick) to do anything unexpected once
it's typed into the shared, real interactive shell. This validation runs
before the command is even written into a request file, exactly like it ran
before the old `ssh` argv was built - moving the execution path did not
change this guarantee.
