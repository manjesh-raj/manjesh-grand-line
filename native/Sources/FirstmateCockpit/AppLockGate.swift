// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-09 (production-readiness review, section 15, High): the app lock's
// coverage. `LockScreenController`'s overlay is a subview of the main window's
// root, and `AppDelegate.setContentMenusEnabled` disables menu *items* - so
// before this file, everything that lives outside that one window kept working
// while locked. The review verified, and this is the honest list:
//
//  - The Shift menu-bar status item kept showing the due count in its title,
//    kept opening its popover (which discloses the next follow-up's title),
//    and its quick-add kept writing tasks - and pushing them to GitHub.
//  - ⌥Space quick capture still opened and still wrote.
//  - Dictation still recorded, transcribed, sent the transcript to `claude`,
//    pasted it into whatever had focus, and appended it to history.
//  - A Host Editor window already open at lock time stayed fully usable, at
//    `.floating` level, above the lock screen.
//
// Against the lock's actual threat model - somebody walking up to an unlocked
// Mac - each of those both discloses data and accepts writes.
//
// ## Why a separate gate rather than checks against `AppLockController`
//
// The surfaces above are not owned by the window: two are global `NSEvent`
// monitors, one is an `NSStatusItem`, one is a floating window. They have no
// path to the shell controller, and giving them one would mean four new
// dependencies pointing the wrong way through the app (`ShiftMenuBar` knowing
// about `AppShellController` is exactly the coupling this codebase's
// forward-don't-own convention exists to avoid).
//
// So this is one tiny piece of shared state that anything may read. The lock
// controller is its only writer, which keeps "am I locked" single-sourced -
// and a surface that forgets to consult it is a visible one-line omission
// rather than a subtle wiring bug.
//
// ## The rule for adding a surface
//
// Any code path that (a) runs while the main window is not frontmost, and
// (b) either shows the captain's data or writes it, must consult `allows(_:)`.
// Add a case rather than reusing a loosely-related one: the case names are
// what `Phase2HardeningSelfTest` asserts, and a shared case would hide a
// surface losing its gate.
