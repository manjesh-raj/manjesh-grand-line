// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// The window's root content view controller: a fixed `IconRailController` on
// the left, and to its right a `TopBarController` (always visible) above a
// body area that swaps between five destinations:
//
//   - .overview shows `FleetController` (Fix 1): the real fleet/PR dashboard.
//   - .hosts shows `HostsController` (Fix 2) as its own full destination -
//     no longer nested inside Console, so it's reachable exactly like
//     Settings is. As of Phase 5 of the full-app UI audit that destination
//     also owns SSH Keys and Snippets as segmented tabs, so the two floating
//     windows those used to live in no longer exist.
//   - .console shows `ConsoleController` alone: just the terminal/tabs area,
//     with no Hosts panel required to be visible alongside it.
//   - .review shows `ReviewController` (Fix 3, theme-audit task): the real,
//     data-backed PR review list, replacing the earlier "coming soon"
//     `PlaceholderViewController`.
//   - .settings shows `SettingsController` directly, in the body area rather
//     than a separate floating window, matching how the web app's Settings
//     is a `view`, not a window.
//
// Fix 1 (dedicated host pages) adds a sixth kind of destination that isn't
// part of the fixed `RailDestination` enum: one independent `ConsoleController`
// per connected host, holding only that host's own ssh tab(s) - never mixed
// with the Firstmate console's Mirror/Shell tabs. These are built lazily via
// `makeHostConsole` the first time `connectHost` sees a given host id, then
// kept around (and re-shown, not re-opened) for as long as that host stays
// saved - see `connectHost`/`removeHostConsole` below.
//
// Every destination view - the five fixed ones and any host page - is added
// as a child up front (or lazily for host pages) and just has its `isHidden`
// flipped, never rebuilt, so nothing here can drop a running terminal session
// or its tabs.
