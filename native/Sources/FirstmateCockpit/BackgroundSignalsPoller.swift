// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Background poll (`fm/grandline-notification-center`) for the four
// Notification Center signals that, before this task, only ever recomputed
// on an explicit page visit: tool updates (Updates page), fork drift
// (GitHub Sync page), Vault attention, and Bootstrap's own setup-drift
// check. Every one of these already has a real, non-duplicated check
// function (`UpdatesSource.check`, `GitHubSyncSource.check`,
// `VaultSource.loadSnapshot`, `SetupStepChecks.*`) - this file only owns
// *when* to call them for the purpose of keeping the in-app Notification
// Center current, never a second implementation of what "needs attention"
// means for any of them.
//
// Cadence tradeoff (the design doc flagged exactly this as worth a
// deliberate decision, not a default): these checks shell out to `brew`/
// `npm`/`gh api`/`av` once per catalog item/repo/tool - `FleetNotifier`'s
// 30s cadence would mean dozens of process spawns every half-minute even
// while the captain is looking at something else entirely, which is a real
// background cost for signals that change on the order of hours, not
// seconds (a tool doesn't get a new release, a fork doesn't fall behind,
// every 30 seconds). This poller runs every 15 minutes instead - "no dead/
// excessive polling" per this app's own standing bar, while still staying
// materially fresher than "only when you happen to open that page." Each
// of the four pages' own on-visit checks are unaffected and still run
// independently at their existing cadence (page visit / manual refresh) -
// this poller exists purely so the notification center doesn't go stale
// between visits, not to replace those pages' own logic.
//
// All four checks run sequentially on one background queue, not
// concurrently - mirrors `BootstrapController.installAllMissing`'s own
// "never race two package-manager invocations against each other" caution,
// generalized here since `brew`/`npm`/`av` can all be invoked across the
// four checks.
