// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// The bordered-terminal-card chrome Console paints over its terminal area
// while the current tab has SRE Lead active (`fm/grandline-sre-lead-app-
// feel`, from the captain's own reference mockup at
// `data/grandline-sre-lead-app-feel/reference-mockup.html`): the terminal
// reads as a rounded, bordered, elevated card floating on a workspace floor
// beside the SRE Lead panel, instead of a raw terminal butted flush against a
// side pane.
//
// **Why this is a drawn overlay and not a container view.** The obvious
// implementation - wrap the terminal in a card view and inset/resize that
// card when the pane opens - is exactly the bug `fm/cockpit-sre-lead-ux-fixes`
// already fixed once: any frame change on a SwiftTerm `TerminalView` triggers
// `resize(cols:rows:)`, which reflows the buffer at the new column count and
// can truncate scrollback a captain had already built up logging into a
// bastion. `ConsoleController`'s own layout comment spells that out, which is
// why the pane *overlays* `content` rather than pushing it.
//
// So the card look is achieved without moving the terminal at all:
//
//   * Every terminal on a host page is inset from `content` by a **permanent**
//     `pad` on all four sides (`ConsoleController.terminalInset`), fixed for
//     the controller's whole lifetime. That inset is what gives the card its
//     margin, and because it never changes, toggling SRE Lead is a pure
//     appearance change - this view's `isHidden`/`needsDisplay`, nothing else.
//   * With the pane closed the inset band is filled by `content`'s own
//     `backgroundHex` - the terminal's own background colour - so it reads as
//     ordinary terminal padding, not as a card.
//   * With the pane open this view (the topmost subview of `content`, and
//     hit-test transparent) paints the workspace floor over everything outside
//     the card, plus the card's rounded border and its drop shadow. The
//     terminal keeps its full width underneath; the strip between the card's
//     drawn trailing edge and the pane is simply covered, exactly as the pane
//     itself already covers the 380pt beneath it.
//
// **Daylight (§6.13) shows this card permanently, not only with SRE Lead up.**
// Its surround is warm `paper` rather than the terminal's own background, so
// without the card the terminal would have no boundary at all - which is what
// §6.13 means by "the same permanent-inset pattern ... re-tinted for a light
// surround". Nothing about the mechanism changes: still an overlay, still no
// frame change, still one `isHidden` flag (`ConsoleController
// .updateTerminalCardStyle`). The shared Firstmate console has
// `terminalInset == 0` and therefore no margin to draw a card in, so it stays
// flush at full column count in every palette.
//
// The one visible cost of that trade: the card's drawn trailing edge sits
// `gap` points left of the pane, so the terminal's rightmost ~1.5 columns are
// hidden while SRE Lead is open - alongside the ~45 columns the pane itself
// has always covered. Nothing is hidden on the leading/top/bottom edges,
// because the terminal is genuinely inset there.
