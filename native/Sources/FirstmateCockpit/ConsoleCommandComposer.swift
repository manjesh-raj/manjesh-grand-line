// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Phase 3 of "Knowledge and speed" (`fm/grandline-console-command-composer`):
// Console's "✨ Compose" control turns a plain-English description of intent
// into a real shell command via one non-interactive
// `claude -p ... --output-format json` call - the exact same `Process`/
// argument/parsing shape `DictationCleanup.swift` and `SRELeadPostmortem.swift`
// already established (see either file's own header for the full reasoning:
// `json` over `stream-json` since only the final reply text is ever needed,
// `/dev/null` stdin to skip `claude -p`'s ~3s piped-stdin probe, draining both
// pipes before `waitUntilExit()` to avoid a full-buffer deadlock). This is a
// third caller of that same shape, not a fourth invention - `SRELead.
// resolveClaude()` is reused as-is, exactly like the other two already do.
//
// The generated command is never run automatically. `ConsoleComposerController`
// (`ConsoleComposerPopover.swift`) is the one UI surface that calls `generate`,
// and it only ever shows the result for review - `ConsoleController`'s "Run in
// terminal" action is the sole path that sends it to a real tab, via the exact
// same `TerminalView.send(txt:)` a Snippet's own "Run" action already uses.
//
// A `claude -p` failure (bad path, no auth, timeout, garbled response) is
// always reported as a clean `.failure`, never a crash - the popover shows it
// inline and lets the captain retry with the same intent text still in the
// field.
