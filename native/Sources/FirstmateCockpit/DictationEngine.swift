// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Dictation, phase 1 (fm/grandline-dictation-mvp): a first-party, in-process
// dictation pipeline - not an integration with the third-party
// "OpenSuperWhisper" app, which a captain-approved Lavish plan discussion
// explicitly rejected as impractical (different build system, a Rust-based
// engine incompatible with this app's plain-`swift build`-only, no-Xcode
// convention - see this project's own `native/README.md`/`CLAUDE.md`
// conventions).
//
// The pipeline is entirely Apple frameworks, no vendored engine:
//   - `AVAudioEngine` captures microphone audio while Right ⌥ Option is held.
//   - `SFSpeechRecognizer` (Apple's built-in Speech framework) transcribes it,
//     requesting on-device recognition (`requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true`)
//     whenever the recognizer reports it supports that for the current
//     locale/OS - falling back to Apple's server-backed recognition
//     otherwise, since not every locale/OS combination supports on-device.
//   - The final recognized text is pasted at the current cursor position via
//     `NSPasteboard` + a synthetic Cmd+V (`CGEvent`), not the Accessibility
//     `AXUIElement` API - see `DictationEngine.pasteAtCursor` below for why
//     that was the more reliable choice in practice.
//
// Vendoring `whisper.cpp` was explicitly ruled out of this phase (only ever a
// later upgrade path if Apple's Speech framework proves insufficient in real
// use) - see this file's own header and `CLAUDE.md`'s "Dictation" section for
// the full phase 1/2/3 split.
//
// Permission state (`DictationPermissions`) is read fresh every time via the
// real system APIs, never cached/assumed - `DictationController` polls it on
// every `viewWillAppear` and `DictationEngine.startRecording()` re-checks it
// before ever opening the microphone, so a permission revoked in System
// Settings after this app launched is caught immediately rather than only at
// next relaunch.
