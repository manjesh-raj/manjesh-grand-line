// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Data side of the Bootstrap page's "Dotfiles & machine config" card and its
// "Global agent instructions" verification section (cockpit-bootstrap-
// dotfiles, phase 2 of the Bootstrap plan - phase 1 shipped the page shell +
// the Firstmate-home card, see `BootstrapController.swift`).
//
// The captain's real machine config lives in a Nix flake at `~/manjesh/dotfiles`
// (nix-darwin + home-manager + nix-homebrew), symlinked to the well-known
// `~/.dotfiles` by that repo's own `bootstrap.sh`/`rebuild.sh`. Every check
// here shells out to the real `git`/`ssh-keygen`-style CLIs a human would use
// (mirrors `UpdatesData.swift`'s `run`/`resolveExecutable` plumbing) or reads
// real files - nothing here is a hardcoded "looks fine" status.
//
// `home.nix` declares `home.file.<path>.source = mkOutOfStoreSymlink
// "${dotfiles}/home/<path>"` for a handful of dotfiles, and three separate
// harness-expected filenames (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`,
// `.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`) all pointed at the one `home/AGENTS.md`.
// Verified live on this machine: each resolves through an intermediate
// `/nix/store/.../home-manager-files/...` -> `/nix/store/.../hm_AGENTS.md`
// hop before landing on the real repo file, so a single `destination(atPath:)`
// call is not enough - checks below fully resolve the symlink chain via
// `resolvingSymlinksInPath` (equivalent to `readlink -f`) rather than
// reading just the first link's target. `.zshrc` is genuinely different: its
// `home.nix` entry is `programs.zsh` (home-manager *generates* the file)
// rather than a `home.file` source symlink, so it resolves straight into the
// Nix store with no repo path in the chain at all - the managed-items check
// below will correctly report it as "not linked to repo", which is accurate,
// not a bug.
