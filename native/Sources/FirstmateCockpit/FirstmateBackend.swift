// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Resolves firstmate's OWN configured/live-detected runtime backend (tmux vs.
// herdr) so the Mirror tab can follow it instead of assuming tmux
// unconditionally (cockpit-mirror-herdr-aware). An explicit override -
// `FM_BACKEND` env, then `config/backend` - is still resolved by sourcing the
// real `bin/fm-backend.sh` and calling its own `fm_backend_name`/
// `fm_backend_herdr_session`, the same "shell out to firstmate's own bin/
// script rather than re-derive its logic" convention `FleetData.swift`'s
// `crewState(taskID:)` already uses for `fm-crew-state.sh`. That keeps the
// cockpit's answer to an explicit override identical to firstmate's own, even
// as `fm-backend.sh`'s config-file/env-var handling evolves.
//
// Absent an explicit override, `fm_backend_name` falls through to
// `fm_backend_detect`'s runtime auto-detection, which answers "what backend
// should a BRAND-NEW CREWMATE SPAWN use" by reading ambient markers
// (`$TMUX`, `HERDR_ENV=1`, ...) from the CALLING PROCESS's own environment -
// correct for a process spawned from within firstmate's own already-running
// session, which genuinely inherits that marker. It is the wrong question for
// this Cockpit app: the app is a standalone GUI launched by Finder/`open`,
// never spawned by herdr or tmux, so its own process environment can
// STRUCTURALLY never carry `HERDR_ENV=1` even when herdr is the fleet's real,
// live backend (cockpit-mirror-backend-resolve-fix, a follow-up to
// cockpit-mirror-herdr-aware found live: this always fell through to the
// final `tmux` default and silently reproduced the pre-herdr-support "no
// server running" bug). So `resolve()` below deliberately does NOT call
// `fm_backend_name` when no explicit override is set - do not "simplify" this
// back to a single `fm_backend_name` shell-out; that would reintroduce the
// exact bug this file was patched for. Instead it asks a genuinely different
// question - "what backend does the ambient fleet actually appear to be
// running on, right now" - via live evidence: a real, running herdr session
// matching `herdrSessionName()`, checked directly against herdr's own current
// CLI surface (`herdr session list --json`). There is no separate live-tmux
// check: `.tmux` is already the answer for every other case (explicit tmux,
// no live herdr evidence, herdr not installed, the shell-out failing), so
// checking for live herdr evidence is the only thing that can flip the
// answer away from that default - which is exactly "prefer whichever backend
// shows live evidence, falling back to tmux when neither does" collapsed to
// its one decision-relevant check.
//
// Only `tmux` and `herdr` are given a native Mirror implementation here
// (`TmuxMirror`/`HerdrMirror`); `fm-backend.sh` also names `zellij`, `orca`,
// and `cmux` as experimental backends, but this task's scope is tmux/herdr
// only (per its brief). Any backend name other than exactly `herdr` resolves
// to `.tmux` here, which reproduces today's pre-existing behavior for those
// backends unchanged (an unsupported-backend fleet already got a tmux-shaped
// "no such session" error before this task; it still does).
