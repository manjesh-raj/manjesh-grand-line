// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// The app's design system: shared metric/type tokens, the one card container
// every page's sections are built out of, the one button, and the one
// accent-carrying row.
//
// **Why this file exists.** The full-app UI audit
// (`data/grandline-full-ui-audit/report.md`) measured what a couple of dozen
// independent per-page redesigns had accumulated: five different card recipes
// visible side by side (radius 10 / 12 / 13 / 14, two fill opacities), the
// same `card(icon:title:content:)` helper copied byte-for-byte into four
// controllers, its theming loop copied verbatim into six, three page gutters
// (18 / 20 / 28pt) and eighteen distinct `systemFont` point sizes with three
// of them all doing "card title". None of that variation encoded a product
// decision - navigating Bootstrap -> Shift changed both the card translucency
// and the page gutter at once for no reason. This file is §6.2 (tokens) plus
// §6.3 components 1 (`HelmCard`, phase 1), 3 (`HelmButton`, phase 2), 2
// (`HelmAccentRow`, phase 3) and 4/5/6 (`HelmStatTile`, `HelmEmptyState`,
// `HelmSegmentedTabs`, phase 4) of that report.
//
// **Nothing here is a new design decision.** Every number below is one of the
// values already in the codebase, promoted to be the single one. `HelmCard`'s
// own chrome is `ShiftPanelView`'s (recipe C - opaque surface, `line @ 0.6`
// border, radius 12, a real header divider), which the audit picked as the
// model, widened with `SettingsController.card`'s icon-tile + title + subtitle
// header. The `ShiftPanelView` name is gone: this is that class, renamed and
// generalised, so there is one card component rather than two under different
// names.
//
// **Adding a new page section?** Build a `HelmCard`, give it a header
// (structured or arbitrary) and a body. Do not hand-roll a rounded background
// view, and do not add another `cardBackgrounds`-style theming registry - a
// `HelmCard` themes itself, including its own icon tile and header labels.

/// button paints literal system blue (`#0a84ff` measured; `controlAccentColor`
/// is `#007aff`, `selectedContentBackgroundColor` `#0059d1`) - none of which
/// has any relationship to the 12 Helm accents
/// (`#6cd7e3 #007194 #2aa198 #cba6f7 #8839ef #fe8019 #af3a03 #7aa2f7 #2959aa
/// #c4a7e7 #286983`, no overlap). So a fully themed app still read as generic
/// system chrome, and the report's own conclusion was that this one component
/// "would change the app's perceived age more than any other single change."
///
/// **Nothing here is a new visual invention.** The recipe is
/// `UpdatesController`'s Refresh pill - the single correctly-themed primary
/// action that already existed - promoted into a real control: an opaque
/// `accentHex` fill with a `selectionTextHex` label. That pairing is not a
/// guess either; `selectionTextHex` is SwiftTerm's own selected-text tone,
/// already contrast-verified against an opaque `accentHex` in every palette
/// (and re-asserted per theme by `HelmContrastSelfTest`).
///
/// **How it stops being a bezel.** `isBordered = false` makes AppKit draw no
/// bezel at all - verified by rendering a real default button both ways: the
/// stock one composites its bezel material, the unbordered one captures fully
/// transparent. So the Return-key shortcut (`keyEquivalent = "\r"`, which
/// every migrated site keeps) survives while the blue *look* has nothing left
/// to paint. Chrome then comes from the view's own layer, and the label from
/// `attributedTitle` - `contentTintColor` does not colour a string title,
/// only an image, which is why three pages had already hand-rolled exactly
/// this workaround before it was shared (`UpdatesController`'s "Install in
/// Bootstrap", `CommandLibraryViews`' Copy and Favorite).
///
/// **It themes itself**, like `HelmCard`: it registers its own
/// `ThemeManager.observe` and unregisters in `deinit`, so no page has to keep
/// a button registry. That is deliberate rather than convenient - a per-page

/// The app's one "accent-carrying row": a coloured left accent bar, a tinted

/// a body line, an optional meta line, and a tinted chip - on a card whose
/// border is a wash of the same hue.
///
/// **Why this exists.** The audit (§3.2, "Accent-bar card with an uppercase
/// kicker") found **four independent copies** of this one idea. All four
/// agreed on the 3pt bar at radius 1.5 and the radius-10 card, and disagreed
/// on everything else: three separate kicker constructions at three kern
/// values (0.9 / 0.7 / 0.6), two badge treatments, and one outlier
/// (`SRELeadChatView.accentCard`) with no border at all whose kicker was
/// coloured from the tint hue rather than `mutedInk`. A fifth surface,
/// Overview's "In flight" rows, had the badge and the chip but neither the
/// bar nor the kicker. The visible consequence: an SRE Lead "Finding" and a
/// Notification "PR Ready" - both meaning *here is a coloured, kickered
/// finding* - did not read as the same kind of object.
///
/// **Nothing here is a new design.** This is `NotificationRowView`
/// (`NotificationCenterPopover.swift`), which the audit called "the only
/// place in the app where the whole recipe is correct at once" and which the
/// captain singled out as the template, promoted and parameterised. Its
/// geometry, its `HoverHighlightView` card, its `tint @ 0.4` border, its
/// 26pt circular `IconTileView` badge and its `ToolRowLayout.pill` chip are
/// carried over unchanged; the row is now built once here instead of five
/// times across four files.
///
/// **The one rule that matters when extending this**: the kicker is
/// `HelmTheme.mutedInk`, never the tint hue. A `HelmTint` hue is safe as a
/// *fill* or a *bar* and is not automatically safe as *text* - see
/// `HelmContrast`'s doc comment and audit §5.7. That is why the tint reaches
/// the bar, the badge and the chip here and never the kicker, and it is
/// checked by `HelmContrastSelfTest.checkNoHandRolledKickers`.
///
/// **Not merged with `ToolRowLayout`**, deliberately: that is a dense
/// checklist row (fixed name/status columns, action buttons, a disclosure
/// chevron and an expandable log) and this is an alert/task card. They share
/// the primitives that carry the visual language - `ToolRowLayout.pill`,
