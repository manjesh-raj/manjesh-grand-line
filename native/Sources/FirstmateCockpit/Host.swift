// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// The SSH **host** model. Phase 1 of the connection-manager work (design report
// `data/cockpit-ssh-manager-research/report.md`, Section A2/A3 + Section D
// Phase 1): a saved SSH profile the captain can connect to. Persistence lives in
// `HostStore`; this file is just the value type, the icon/colour catalogue, and
// the `ssh` argv builder.
//
// Phase 2 replaces the Phase 1 "on-disk key path" credential with a real
// saved-key reference (`keyID`, into `SSHKeyStore` / `KeychainKeyStore`) - the
// only thing persisted here is a `UUID`, never key material. With no key
// chosen, `ssh` falls back to the system agent / `known_hosts` and prompts
// interactively on the PTY, same as Phase 1. A typed-in `password` is held in
// memory for the session and is deliberately excluded from `Codable`.
//
// Phase 3 (design report Section B1/B4/B5, Section D Phase 3) adds the
// "power features" that make this usable against real infra, all as extra
// non-secret fields plus extra `ssh` argv - never new transport code:
// agent forwarding (`-A`), a jump-host chain (`-J`, `jumpVia`), local/remote/
// dynamic port-forwarding rules, and an optional startup snippet. `group` and
// `tags` (B4) already existed as unused fields; Phase 3 is what wires them
// into the sidebar.
