// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Host persistence. The native app had **zero** persistence before Phase 1
// (config was env-var only, design report A2), so this is the first on-disk
// store: a small JSON file of saved `Host` profiles under Application Support.
//
// Secrets never land here - `Host`'s `password` is excluded from `Codable`, and
// the only credential persisted is an on-disk key *path*. Phase 2 replaces that
// with a Keychain / Secure Enclave key store.
