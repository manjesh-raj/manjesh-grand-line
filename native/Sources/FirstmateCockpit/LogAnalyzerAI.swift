// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// `fm/grandline-log-analyzer-build`, spec §4 (structured analysis), §9
// (inferred/unknown correlation), §10 (root cause with confidence), §11
// (suggested commands), §12 (what evidence is still missing) and §22
// (analysis modes).
//
// **Invocation shape.** One non-interactive `claude -p ... --output-format
// json` process per Analyze press - the same shape `SRELeadRunner.swift`
// established and `DictationCleanup.swift`/`SRELeadPostmortem.swift`/
// `ConsoleCommandComposer.swift` already reuse (see `SRELeadRunner`'s header
// for the full reasoning: `json` over `stream-json` because only the final
// reply is ever needed, `/dev/null` stdin to skip `claude -p`'s ~3s piped-
// stdin probe, both pipes drained before `waitUntilExit()` to avoid a
// full-buffer deadlock). No HTTP client, no API key, no second AI mechanism.
// `SRELead.resolveClaude()` is reused as-is, exactly as those three do.
//
// Deliberately not reusing `SRELeadRunner` itself: that type threads a
// `session_id` across turns for a conversation pane and carries an MCP
// config plus a restricted `--allowedTools` for its kubectl tool. This is a
// stateless, single-turn, tool-free request whose reply must parse as one
// fixed JSON object - a fifth small caller of the same `Process` shape is
// clearer than stretching that one to cover both.
//
// **Redaction ordering (spec §14).** Every string this file puts in a prompt
// arrives already redacted: `LogAnalyzerController` runs `LogRedactor.redact`
// at evidence-creation time and stores only the masked text on
// `LogEvidenceItem.text`, so there is no unredacted copy left anywhere for
// this file to read even by mistake. `LogAnalyzerSelfTest` proves the
// property the only way that means anything - by grepping the literal bytes
// of a built prompt for planted secret values.
//
// **What the model is not allowed to do.** The prompt asks for JSON only,
// and `parse` is strict about the shape - but two rules are enforced in code
// rather than trusted to the prompt:
//   1. A correlation link the model labels "observed" is downgraded to
//      "inferred" (spec §9 - only the local layer counted the lines, so only
//      it may claim something was observed; see `LogCorrelationBuilder`).
//   2. Suggested commands are re-pointed at the captain's own Command
//      Library afterwards by `LogAnalyzerCommandMatcher` (spec §11's "do not
//      generate arbitrary commands if an equivalent saved command exists"),
//      rather than the model being asked to remember the library's contents.

        Rules you must follow:
        - Base every claim on the provided output. If something cannot be established from \
        what is here, say so in "missingEvidence" rather than asserting it.
        - Never state a root cause with more confidence than the evidence supports. \
        "confidence" must be one of "high", "medium", "low".
        - The occurrence counts below were computed locally over the complete input and are \
        exact. Do not recompute, estimate, or contradict them.
        - Do not invent timestamps. Only reference times that appear in the provided output.
        - Every correlation link must be labelled "inferred" (a likely causal relationship) \
        or "unknown" (something that cannot be established here). Do not label anything \
        "observed" — directly observed facts are added separately by the tool that counted them.
        - Suggested commands must be safe, read-only investigation commands. Never suggest a \
        command that deletes, restarts, scales, applies, or otherwise mutates anything.
        - Redaction has already been applied to the output below. Placeholders reading \
