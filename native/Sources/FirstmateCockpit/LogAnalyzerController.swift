// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// `fm/grandline-log-analyzer-build`: the `.logAnalyzer` rail destination -
// the Log / Output Analyzer's page, and the one place this feature's flow
// lives (collect → analyze → identify → correlate → explain → next steps →
// investigate further → create incident/runbook/ticket).
//
// Everything it *renders* lives in `LogAnalyzerViews.swift`; everything it
// *computes* lives in the pure-logic files (`LogRedactor`,
// `LogSourceDetector`, `LogErrorExtractor`, `LogTimelineBuilder`,
// `LogCorrelationBuilder`, `LogAnalyzerAI`, `LogAnalyzerCommandMatcher`,
// `LogAnalyzerArtifacts`, `LogAnalyzerStore`). Read
// `LogAnalyzerModels.swift`'s header first - it explains the two-layer split
// (local vs. AI) that the whole page is arranged around.
//
// Two rules this controller is responsible for enforcing, both of them
// security-relevant rather than cosmetic:
//
//   1. **Redaction happens on the way in, once** (`addEvidence`). Raw text is
//      a local `let` in that method and is never stored on the model, so no
//      later code path - analysis, storage, copy, artifacts, the terminal
//      bridge - can reach an unredacted string. Spec §14.
//   2. **Nothing is written to disk unless the captain picked a storage
//      option other than the default.** `LogStorageChoice.doNotSave` is the
//      initial value and `persistIfNeeded` is the only writer. Spec §15.
//
// The page never talks to Kubernetes, AWS, a database, or any other
// infrastructure (spec §26). Its only external calls are `claude -p` (via
// `LogAnalyzerAI`, always on already-redacted text) and reads of this app's
// own stores.
