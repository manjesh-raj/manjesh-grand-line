// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// `fm/cockpit-sre-lead-shared-terminal`: the file-based bridge that lets SRE
// Lead's kubectl MCP tool (`native/Scripts/sre_kubectl_mcp.py`, a subprocess of
// `claude`, itself in its own tmux session - see `SRELead.swift`) run a kubectl
// command in the *same, already-authenticated* interactive terminal tab the
// captain used to log all the way into the connected host, instead of opening a
// second, independent SSH connection.
//
// Why: the captain confirmed a hard constraint on the real "EKS Preprod
// Bastion" host - its EKS Bastion hop is username/password-gated by policy,
// with no SSH key auth possible there. Five prior attempts (PRs #70-73, plus
// an abandoned PTY investigation) all tried to make a second, independent,
// fully-automated SSH connection complete that same login chain - which can
// never work, since nothing can supply a password that is not stored
// anywhere, by design. See `sre_kubectl_mcp.py`'s module docstring and the
// AGENTS.md SRE Lead bullet for the full history; do not resurrect a second-
// connection approach for this or any other password-gated hop.
//
// The Python script and this Swift app are different processes with no shared
// memory, so the bridge is a small polling protocol over files in a per-session
// scratch directory (`SRELeadSession.bridgeDir`, created by `SRELead.setUp`):
// Python writes `request-<id>.json` (`{"command": "<kubectl ...>"}`), this
// class notices it, injects `<command>` into the target tab exactly the way
// `Snippet`'s "Run" action already does (`TerminalView.send(txt:)` -
// `ConsoleController.runSnippetInActiveTab`/`runStartupSnippet`), wrapped with
// two fresh random markers so the real output can be extracted unambiguously
// from the tab's scrollback, then writes `response-<id>.json`. Python polls for
// that file to appear (see `_run_kubectl` there) up to its own timeout.
