// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// `fm/grandline-sre-lead-per-tab`: per-tab SRE Lead state. Each `.ssh` tab on
// a dedicated host page now holds its own independent investigation -
// session, bridge, runner, and chat - instead of every tab in the page
// sharing one SRE Lead pinned to whichever tab connected first. This mirrors
// `TabModel.blockTracker`/`blockContainer`, which already live directly on
// `TabModel` for the identical reason: per-tab feature state that outlives a
// tab switch and gets automatic cleanup on tab removal for free, rather than
// a dictionary kept on `ConsoleController` that needs manual bookkeeping (see
// the design doc's Option B, rejected for exactly that reason:
// `data/grandline-sre-lead-per-tab/design-reference.html`).
//
// `ConsoleController`'s `sreLeadPane` stays one shared, fixed slide-open
// panel - every started tab's `chatView` is added as a hidden sibling inside
// it, and only the currently selected tab's is ever shown
// (`ConsoleController.updateSRELeadPaneContent`), the same "hide, don't
// rebuild" convention this app uses everywhere else (block view, Docs tabs,
// Shift's dashboard/weekly-review switch).
