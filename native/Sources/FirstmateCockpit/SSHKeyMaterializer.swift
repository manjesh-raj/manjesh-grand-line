// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.

// Resolves a saved `SSHKey` into a file `ssh -i` can use. This is the one
// place secret key material touches disk at all in this app, and only for as
// long as a connection needs it (design report Section C3: "for imported PEM
// files that must live on disk ... 0600 in an app-group container, never in
// config.json"). The Keychain read inside `materialize` is what triggers the
// Touch ID / passcode prompt (`KeychainKeyStore`); everything after that is
// plain file plumbing, torn down by `cleanup` once the tab that owns it closes
// or reconnects (see `ConsoleController`).
