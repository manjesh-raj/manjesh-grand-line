// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-16: what the accessibility sweep actually guarantees, asserted rather
// than described.
//
// The review scored accessibility 2.5/10 - the app's weakest dimension - with
// one specific, countable finding: ~40 `NSClickGestureRecognizer`-driven
// controls that VoiceOver saw as static text, with no role, no label, and no
// way to activate them. The fix was made once, in the four shared components
// (`HoverHighlightView`, `HelmAccentRow`, `HelmSegmentedTabs`, `HelmStatTile`)
// plus `HelmButton`/`TabChipView`/`HelmTableView`, precisely so it would cover
// all ~40 sites without touching them. That is only true as long as those
// components keep their end of the bargain, which is what this suite pins.
//
// Two invariants matter more than the individual cases:
//
//   1. A control that *does* something announces as a button (or a radio
//      button in a one-of-many strip), carries a real label, and can be
//      pressed - by VoiceOver and from the keyboard.
//   2. A control that does *nothing* stays invisible to assistive technology
//      and out of the key view loop. Flooding VoiceOver with decorative
//      containers is its own accessibility failure, and this app is built
//      almost entirely out of decorative containers.
//
// Run: `FM_RUN_ACCESSIBILITY_TESTS=1 .build/debug/FirstmateCockpit`
//
// No window is created and no AppKit layout pass is needed for any of this,
// which is why this suite runs in CI where the render-based ones cannot.

// GL-27: compiled into debug builds only.
//
// The 51 self-test suites are ~10,500 lines of test code, fault-injection
// seams and fixture data that used to be linked into the binary the captain
// actually runs. `FM_SELFTESTS` is defined by `Package.swift` for the debug
// configuration only, so `swift build` (and therefore CI and
// `Scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) still has every suite, while
// `swift build -c release` - what `native/build_native_app.sh` assembles the
// shipped `.app` from - has none of it.
//
// Do not remove this guard when editing a suite: `Phase3PolishSelfTest`
// asserts that every file in this directory carries it.
