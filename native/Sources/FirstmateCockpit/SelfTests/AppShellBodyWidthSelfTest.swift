// `fm/grandline-live-gap-rootcause-scout`: regression coverage for the
// captain-reported "black/blank gap on the right side of the window" bug.
// The scout report (`data/grandline-live-gap-rootcause-scout/report.md`)
// captured, live, on the captain's own running instance:
//
//   window.frame                = {{0, 0}, {1033, 949}}
//   contentView.frame           = {{0, 0}, {1032.5, 949}}   (tracks window)
//   bodyContainer.frame         = {{84, 0}, {1428, 949}}    (does NOT)
//
// `bodyContainer`'s width (1428) matched the *screen's* width minus the
// rail (1512 - 84), not the window's real, current width minus the rail
// (1033 - 84 = 949) - a 479pt discrepancy repeated identically across
// `bodyContainer` and all twelve destination views mounted inside it. This
// file builds a real `AppShellController` inside a real `NSWindow` (the
// same shape `BlockViewHierarchySelfTest.swift`/`SRELeadPerTabSelfTest.swift`
// already use for this kind of real-view-hierarchy regression test) and
// drives real window resizes through it, asserting `bodyContainer`'s width
// tracks the window's actual current content width at every step - the
// property this task's report found to be violated.
//
// The first two cases are ordinary sanity coverage; they can pass even on
// a build that never hits the specific staleness this task fixed, since a
// freshly-built, freshly-resized hierarchy has no reason to already be
// stale. The third case, `widthSelfHealsAfterATieIsSilentlyBroken`, is what
// actually proves the fix: it deliberately reproduces the exact starting
// condition the live bug exhibited (the width tie inactive, the frame
// stuck at a stale, screen-sized value) via
// `AppShellController.debugBreakBodyWidthTieForTests()`, then fires a real
// resize and asserts `reassertBodyContainerWidthTie()` (wired to
// `NSWindow.didResizeNotification`) repairs it. Confirmed live, per this
// project's own convention, to actually catch a regression rather than
// just pass: temporarily reverting `AppShellController.swift`'s fix (no
// resize observer, no reactivation) makes this exact case fail - the frame
// stays at its stale, pre-break value after the resize, since nothing
// notices the tie is inactive - and reapplying the fix makes it pass again.
//
// `fm/grandline-log-analyzer-body-width-regression` found and fixed a SECOND,
// unrelated way to reach this same symptom (identical geometry, but nothing
// to do with the width-tie staleness above): `LogAnalyzerController`'s
// Compare tab ties `comparePopupBefore`/`comparePopupAfter` to their own
// column at `.required`. That tie is a real, externally-added constraint -
// not one a stack's own `.gravityAreas`/arrangement math would skip for a
// hidden arranged subview - so it stayed fully binding straight through the
// Compare tab (hidden until chosen), `tabContainer` (hidden until an
// analysis exists) and this destination's own root, all the way up to
// `bodyContainer`. A popup's intrinsic width comes from its populated menu
// items (`renderComparePickers()` always adds at least one, and one per
// captured evidence label - free-form text a captain can make arbitrarily
// long), so it could cap the *whole window* at whatever width those items
// needed - on every destination, not just Log Analyzer, since bodyContainer
// is shared. `test_bodyContainerTracksWindowAcrossRealisticWidths` below is
// the regression coverage for that fix - confirmed live, per this project's
// convention, to actually catch it: reverting the `LogAnalyzerController`
// fix (dropping that tie back to `.required`) fails this case at every one
// of its swept widths, not just one, and reapplying the fix passes it again.
//
// `fm/grandline-body-width-regression-recur` found and fixed a THIRD way to
// reach this same symptom, and - unlike the first two, which were each fixed
// in isolation - closed the actual structural gap this time: neither of the
// two cases above ever visits a *lazily*-mounted destination
// (`DestinationRegistry.swift`'s non-`mountsEagerly` set - Hosts, Tasks, Log
// Analyzer, Tools, Vault, Dictation, Schedules, Health, Docs, the other three
// Setup pages, Settings), so a bug confined to one of those could ship clean
// through this whole file, and did: `ToolsController`'s landing-grid title
// label set `.byTruncatingTail` but never lowered its horizontal compression
// resistance off `NSTextField`'s own >500-priority default, so a rebuild at a
// wide window baked an oversized floor into the (permanently-mounted, only-
// ever-hidden - GL-37) Tools view that stuck around long after Tools was
// hidden again, capping every other destination's minimum window width via
// the shared `bodyContainer`. See `test_widthTracksAcrossAllDestinations`'s
// own doc comment for the full root-cause writeup and why its sweep - every
// `RailDestination`, not just the eager three - is what should keep this from
// recurring a fourth time.
//
// Run with:
//   swift build && FM_RUN_APP_SHELL_BODY_WIDTH_TESTS=1 .build/debug/FirstmateCockpit; echo $?

// GL-27: compiled into debug builds only.
//
// The 51 self-test suites are ~10,500 lines of test code, fault-injection
// seams and fixture data that used to be linked into the binary the captain
// actually runs. `FM_SELFTESTS` is defined by `Package.swift` for the debug
// configuration only, so `swift build` (and therefore CI and
// `Scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) still has every suite, while
// `swift build -c release` - what `native/build_native_app.sh` assembles the
// shipped `.app` from - has none of it.
//
// Do not remove this guard when editing a suite: `Phase3PolishSelfTest`
// asserts that every file in this directory carries it.
