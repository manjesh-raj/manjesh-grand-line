// `fm/cockpit-block-view-stage0`: the volume test the scout report
// (`data/cockpit-block-view-scout/report.md`, "Mechanism B") calls for -
// neither prior self-test ever exercised more than 5 hand-built blocks with
// a couple of lines of output each, so neither could have given any signal
// about the plausible-but-unverified main-thread cost blowup under real
// scrollback volume (the same class of pathology this codebase's own
// Diff-tool history hit and fixed at `fm/cockpit-tools-yaml-quotes-diff-perf`
// - see AGENTS.md's Diff-tool bullets for the ~13.6-second `NSStackView`-of-
// hundreds-of-rows blowup that motivated switching that tool to an
// `NSTableView`).
//
// Stage 0 deliberately still renders via a plain `NSStackView`
// (`BlockContainerView`, matching the original PR #79/#83 design) rather
// than pre-emptively rewriting it as an `NSTableView` - the mitigating
// factor here is that Stage 0 only ever renders on an explicit manual
// Refresh click, never per host-output chunk (see `TerminalBlockTracker`'s
// header), so a single render's cost is paid once per click, not once per
// ~128KB of host output the way the original attempt's `refreshRunningBlock`
// wiring made it. This test measures whether that single-click cost is
// still acceptable at real volume, not whether it's zero.
//
// Two phases are measured and reported separately, mirroring how the
// Diff-tool perf fix was verified (actual wall-clock cost at increasing row
// counts, not just "it doesn't crash"): (1) parsing hundreds of OSC-133
// prompt cycles into `TerminalBlock`s via a real `HeadlessTerminal` (the
// same parsing path `TerminalBlockTrackerSelfTest` already covers at small
// scale), and (2) rendering that same block list into a real,
// window-mounted `BlockContainerView` and forcing a real
// `layoutSubtreeIfNeeded()` - the actual Auto Layout cost the Diff-tool
// blowup was in. Run with:
//
//   swift build && FM_RUN_BLOCK_VIEW_VOLUME_TESTS=1 .build/debug/FirstmateCockpit; echo $?

// GL-27: compiled into debug builds only.
//
// The 51 self-test suites are ~10,500 lines of test code, fault-injection
// seams and fixture data that used to be linked into the binary the captain
// actually runs. `FM_SELFTESTS` is defined by `Package.swift` for the debug
// configuration only, so `swift build` (and therefore CI and
// `Scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) still has every suite, while
// `swift build -c release` - what `native/build_native_app.sh` assembles the
// shipped `.app` from - has none of it.
//
// Do not remove this guard when editing a suite: `Phase3PolishSelfTest`
// asserts that every file in this directory carries it.
