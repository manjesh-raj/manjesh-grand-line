//     binary. A new suite added without the guard would quietly put itself
//     back into the shipped app, and nothing else would notice.

//     scale is genuinely reachable from `HelmType` rather than being a stored
//     number nothing reads.

//   - GL-33: the undo toast is one slot, and a plain confirmation cannot
//     accidentally acquire an Undo button.
