// GL-11 / F1 (production-readiness review sections 20 and 25): the registry
// behind the Health card. The review's framing is the point worth keeping -
// "a cockpit whose own gauges can silently die is not glanceable." Before
// this, `BackgroundSignalsPoller`, `FleetNotifier` and `ShiftGitSync` had zero
// log statements between them and no user-visible liveness signal at all, so a
// wedged poller (GL-03) meant notifications went stale forever with nothing
// anywhere saying so.
//
// This is deliberately a *registry*, not a monitor: it never polls anything and
// never decides that a service is unhealthy on its own. Each service reports
// its own outcomes (`recordSuccess`/`recordFailure`), and the registry only
// remembers the last of each plus a consecutive-failure count. That keeps the
// health of a service defined by the service, which is the only place that can
// know what "healthy" means for it.
//
// Two consumers:
//  - `HealthCardView` (Settings) renders one row per service.
//  - After `failureThreshold` consecutive failures, `NotificationSources`
//    raises a `.actionNeeded` entry (GL-30). One failure is noise - a laptop
//    on a train fails a `gh` call constantly; repeated failure is a real
//    signal, and it is the one the review asks to surface.
//
// Everything here stays local: timestamps and error strings in memory, nothing
// persisted, nothing sent anywhere. Error strings come from the same sources
// the logs use, so the "don't log a secret value" rule covers this too - a
// failure detail is a tool's own message, never a credential.
