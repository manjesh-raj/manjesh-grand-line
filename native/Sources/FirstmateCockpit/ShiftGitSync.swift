// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Git-backed sync for Shift's data (cockpit-shift-git-sync, phase 4 of the
// Shift build - see AGENTS.md's "Shift" section for phases 1-3). The
// captain's decision, already made and not relitigated here: Shift's YAML
// files live in a `personal-tasks/` folder inside the existing
// `manjesh-config` GitHub repo, not a separate dedicated repo.
//
// `fm/grandline-docs-knowledge-foundation` moved that folder under a new
// shared `GrandLineDocs/` parent (alongside `GrandLineDocs/runbooks/`, see
// `DocsRunbookSync.swift`) so every piece of data this app syncs to
// `manjesh-config` lives in one place - `Self.shiftSubpath` is the one
// constant that changed, plus a one-time, self-healing repo-layout migration
// (`migrateRepoLayoutIfNeeded()`) that `git mv`s an old top-level
// `personal-tasks/` into `GrandLineDocs/personal-tasks/` the first time any
// client with this code clones/pulls a repo still in the old layout - it
// never re-fires once any client has pushed the move, since the new location
// then already exists in every later clone.
//
// This reuses the exact shape `DotfilesData.swift` already established for a
// local-clone-plus-shell-`git` workflow (clone / `pull --ff-only` / plain
// `Process`-based shelling out, never a git library), and
// `DocsSyncSource.ghAuthToken()` (`DocsData.swift`) for auth - no second git-
// sync mechanism, no second credential path.
//
// The speed contract: every UI-triggered write already happens synchronously
// to the local YAML file via `ShiftYaml`/`ShiftStore`, with zero git/network
// involvement in that call - see `ShiftStore.persist*` methods. This class
// only owns what happens *after* that local write: a debounced background
// commit+push, and a periodic/launch-time pull. The UI never waits on
// anything in this file.
