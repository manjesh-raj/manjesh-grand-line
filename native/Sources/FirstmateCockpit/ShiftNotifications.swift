// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Local notifications for due tasks and follow-ups (phase 5, cockpit-shift-
// power-features). Follows `FleetNotifier.swift`'s established shape
// (background poll + "already notified" set + an immediate, trigger-less
// `UNNotificationRequest`) rather than `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger`
// scheduling - simpler to reason about and verify, and consistent with the
// one other place this app already does due-item alerting.
//
// Authorization is requested once at `start()` (safe to call every launch -
// a no-op once already determined, same as `FleetNotifier.start()`) and
// every call site here tolerates a denial gracefully: `requestAuthorization`'s
// `granted` flag is only logged, never asserted on, and `poll()` still runs
// on schedule regardless - `UNUserNotificationCenter.add` simply drops a
// request silently if the user never granted permission, so there is
// nothing to special-case in the scheduling logic itself.
