// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Shift's local data layer (cockpit-shift-foundation, phase 1). Backed by
// batched YAML files under a captain-configurable root - see AGENTS.md's
// "Shift" section for the full directory layout and which phases still own
// Git sync / creation / editing / search. This phase's store only needs to:
// load `tasks/active.yaml` and `follow-ups/follow-ups.yaml` into memory,
// persist a status change back to `active.yaml`, and move a task into the
// correct month's `tasks/completed/<YYYY-MM>.yaml` file the moment it's
// marked completed - not the fuller CRUD a create/edit phase will add.
//
// Follows `HostStore.swift`'s established shape (in-memory array backed by a
// file, `FM_HOSTS_FILE`-style env override, observer list) and
// `DotfilesData.swift`'s "shell out / read real files, nothing fabricated"
// rule - just against a directory tree instead of a single JSON file.
