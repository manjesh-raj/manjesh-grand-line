// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Shift's own presentation layer (fm/cockpit-shift-ui-polish), matching the
// captain-approved mockup at
// data/cockpit-shift-ui-polish/reviewed-mockup-reference.html. This is
// deliberately the *only* new file this pass adds: everything else - dark
// palette, priority/status/sync tint colors, hover highlighting - already
// existed and was already wired into `ThemeManager`/`HelmTint`/
// `HoverHighlightView` before this pass (see ShiftController.swift's header
// for what the root-cause check actually found). The one thing genuinely
// missing was the mockup's three-typeface system - every Shift label used
// the app's default `.systemFont` sans face, with no serif/mono distinction
// anywhere - plus a shared bordered-panel container matching the mockup's
// `.panel`/`.panel-head`. Both are Shift-specific per the task brief ("extend
// the tokens where Shift needs something the rest of the app doesn't have
// yet"), not a second app-wide font/color system: every color here still
// flows through `HelmTheme`/`HelmTint` exactly like the rest of the app.

/// about the look changed in that move.

/// `ShiftEmptyStateView` used to live here - the centered icon-over-copy
/// "nothing here yet" placeholder every table-backed list in the app used. It
/// is now `HelmEmptyState` in `HelmDesignSystem.swift`, where it is the app's
/// single empty state rather than one of six (full-app UI audit §6.3
/// component 5), widened with `DocsController`'s Playbook empty state's title
/// and action button. Its `.compact` size renders exactly as this class did.
