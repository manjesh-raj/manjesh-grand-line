// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-05: refuse to run two copies of this app at once.
//
// Why this is a real problem and not hygiene: every JSON store in this app is
// load-once-then-last-writer-wins (`HostStore`, `SSHKeyStore`, `SnippetStore`,
// `DictationStore`), so instance A's stale `persist()` silently discards
// everything B saved since A launched - with no error and, crucially, no
// corrupt-file backup either, because the file it overwrites decodes perfectly
// well. Worse, two processes share one Shift git working tree with a
// *per-process* serial queue, so they collide on `.git/index.lock` (which
// `ShiftGitSync`'s own comments name), and first-run `ensureWorkingTreeNow()`
// does a `removeItem` + `moveItem` swap - a second instance arriving mid-swap
// deletes the clone the first one just installed.
//
// AGENTS.md already documents that every build of this app shares one bundle
// identity and that accidental second instances are a real, recurring event on
// this machine. So this file has to cover two shapes:
//
//  1. **A second bundled `.app` launch.** `LSMultipleInstancesProhibited` in
//     the Info.plist (see `build_native_app.sh`) makes Launch Services
//     activate the running copy instead of starting a new process, so in the
//     normal double-click case this code never even runs. The
//     `NSRunningApplication` check below is the belt-and-braces version for
//     the paths that bypass Launch Services (`open -n`, running the binary
//     inside the bundle directly).
//  2. **An unbundled `swift run` / `.build/debug` binary**, which has no
//     bundle identifier at all, so neither of the above applies. That is
//     exactly the case AGENTS.md warns about (a worktree build colliding with
//     the captain's real running instance), and it is covered by the advisory
//     `flock` on a lock file in Application Support - which also catches a
//     bundled copy vs. an unbundled one, since both take the same lock.
//
// Deliberately *not* covered: the self-test binaries. Every `FM_RUN_*_TESTS=1`
// invocation runs headless and exits before touching `NSApplication`, and
// several of them legitimately run while the captain's real app is open, so
// `acquire()` is called from `applicationDidFinishLaunching`'s path only - not
// from `main.swift`'s top level.
