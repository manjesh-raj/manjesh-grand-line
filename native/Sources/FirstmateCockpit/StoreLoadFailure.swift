// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// The one place a store backs up a file it could not decode (GL-01, phase 1
// of the production-readiness review). `HostStore.load()` already had the
// correct shape - back the undecodable file up to `<name>.corrupt-<ts>`
// *before* anything can atomically overwrite it, expose the backup path, and
// log - while `SSHKeyStore`, `SnippetStore`, `DictationStore` and Shift's
// YAML loading all did `(try? decode(...)) ?? []` and then persisted over the
// file on the very next mutation, permanently destroying data that was only
// transiently unreadable. This file lifts that block out of `HostStore` so
// every store calls one implementation instead of four near-copies.
//
// Two rules worth keeping in mind when adding a new store:
//
//  1. **"File missing" and "file present but unreadable" are different
//     states.** Missing legitimately means "empty, start fresh". Unreadable
//     means "there is real data here that I cannot understand" - and the only
//     safe response is to preserve it. A single `try?` collapses both into
//     the first, which is exactly the bug GL-01 describes.
//  2. **A `.copyItem` (not `.moveItem`) is deliberate.** The original file
//     stays exactly where it is, so if the failure was transient (a partial
//     write from a killed process, a file the captain was hand-editing at
//     that moment) a relaunch can still read it successfully. The backup is
//     insurance, not a quarantine.
