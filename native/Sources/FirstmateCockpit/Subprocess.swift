// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-02 / GL-03 / GL-04 / GL-15 / GL-26 (production-readiness review). This is
// the app's one subprocess runner. Before it existed there were ~25 hand-rolled
// `Process` call sites across 21 files, seven copies of `resolveExecutable`,
// ten result structs, four identical git-auth blocks and five `claude -p`
// runners - and, more to the point, three distinct *classes* of live deadlock
// spread across them:
//
//  - **Wait-before-drain.** `proc.waitUntilExit()` before reading either pipe.
//    A child emitting more than one pipe buffer (~64KB) blocks forever, and so
//    does the thread waiting on it. `FleetDataSource.mergePR` had exactly this,
//    which is why a chatty merge script left the Merge button disabled for the
//    rest of the session. (Phase 1 hand-fixed that one site and `SSHKeyGenerator`.)
//  - **The half-fix: stdout to EOF, *then* stderr, then wait.** ~12 helpers
//    had this, and their own comments show the deadlock was understood - the
//    fix just only covered the stdout half. A child that fills the 64KB
//    *stderr* pipe while stdout is still open deadlocks identically, which is
//    entirely realistic for `npm -g`, `brew upgrade`, git advice output, or
//    `av`/`gh` failure spew. **This is the case `SubprocessSelfTest`'s
//    stderr-flood child pins**, because it is the one that reads as already
//    fixed.
//  - **Never-read stderr pipes.** A `Pipe()` attached to `standardError` and
//    never read is a 64KB fuse on the child. (Phase 1 converted five of these
//    in `FleetData` to `nullDevice`.)
//
// ## What this runner guarantees
//
//  1. **Both streams are drained concurrently, always.** Not "stdout first" -
//     concurrently, via `readabilityHandler` into a locked buffer, so neither
//     pipe can fill while the other is being read. A stream the caller does
//     not want is `FileHandle.nullDevice`, never an unread `Pipe`.
//  2. **Every run is bounded.** There is a default timeout, and on expiry the
//     child gets SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after a short grace. A run that times
//     out returns partial output with `timedOut == true` rather than blocking
//     its caller forever. This is what makes GL-03's poller watchdog a
//     backstop rather than the only defence.
//  3. **No thread is left blocked on a pipe.** `readDataToEndOfFile()` does
//     not return until *every* writer closes, which includes a grandchild that
//     inherited the pipe (`brew` spawning background work). Handler-based
//     reads can be torn down on the way out; a blocked `read(2)` cannot.
//  4. **One place for environment and token injection.** `childEnvironmentDict()`
//     is the base for every run (PATH fix-up for a Finder-launched GUI app,
//     `TMUX`/`HERDR_*` stripping), and secrets travel as environment variables
//     - never argv - so they never appear in `ps`. `gitAuthEnvironment` is the
//     single copy of the GitHub Basic-auth `http.extraheader` block that four
//     files each carried.
//  5. **One logging choke point** (GL-11): every non-zero exit, launch failure
//     and timeout is logged with the executable, the exit status and a bounded
//     slice of stderr. Arguments are logged only for the executable's own
//     name plus argv count, because argv can carry a prompt or a path the
//     review's redaction rules cover.
//
// ## What it deliberately does not do
//
// It does not wrap interactive/PTY work. `LocalProcessTerminalView` (every
// terminal tab, including the one-shot Console command tabs) forks its child
// in-process through SwiftTerm and has nothing to do with `Process`; a real
// `sudo` password prompt still needs a real terminal, which is why Bootstrap
// and Settings route through a Console tab rather than through this file.
//
// It is also synchronous by design. Callers that must not block - the pollers,
// the AI one-shots - already own a background queue or a completion handler;
// hiding that behind an async facade here would make the main-thread rule
// harder to see, not easier. `Subprocess.runAsync` exists for the narrow case
// of "I am on the main thread and need this off it" and is a thin wrapper.
