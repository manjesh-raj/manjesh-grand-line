// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// The tab model. Phase 0 of the "cockpit as a connection manager" work (design
// report `data/cockpit-ssh-manager-research/report.md`, Section A4/A5 + Section D
// Phase 0) replaces the old fixed `enum Tab { case shell, mirror }` with a
// flexible collection: the console owns `[TabModel]`, each tab carrying its own
// terminal view, an argv/launch spec, a display name, and its tab-bar chip.
//
// A `TabLaunch` is the reusable "how to (re)start this tab's process" recipe.
// It is what makes **duplicate** trivial - a duplicated tab is a brand new tab
// with the *same* launch - and what **reconnect** re-runs. Adding SSH hosts
// later (Phase 1) is just another `TabLaunch` case.

/// How a tab's child process is (re)started. Kept as a value so duplicating a
/// tab and reconnecting one both reduce to "launch this again".

    /// manager. `ssh` is just another interactive PTY child (design report C1),
    /// so this reuses the same `startProcess` path as `shell`. `hostArgs` is
    /// the non-secret part of the argv (agent forwarding, jump chain, port
    /// forwards, port + destination - see `Host.sshArguments(allHosts:)`);
    /// `keyID`, when set, is a saved key (Phase 2) that `ConsoleController`
    /// resolves through the Keychain into a temporary `-i <path>` on every
    /// start/reconnect - never baked into `hostArgs` itself, so duplicating or
    /// reconnecting this tab always re-resolves the key rather than reusing a
    /// stale temp file. `startupSnippetID` (Phase 3, B2/B5) is a saved
