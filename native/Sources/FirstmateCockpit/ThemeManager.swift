// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// A single source of truth for the app's Helm theme, persisted across
// launches. Before this existed, `ConsoleController` kept its own private
// `theme` var and every other window (Hosts sidebar, Keys, Snippets)
// followed the *system* light/dark appearance instead - the captain-reported
// bug where toggling the in-app theme left the Hosts sidebar stuck in the
// system's appearance while the terminal switched to Helm dark. Anything that
// needs to render in the current Helm theme should read `ThemeManager.shared`
// and register via `observe` rather than tracking its own copy.
//
// Nav-redesign task: grew from 2 palettes (dark/light) to 8
// (`HelmTheme.allThemes`), so persistence keyed on a theme `id` rather than a
// bare "light"/"dark" string; a pre-existing "fm.themeMode" value is migrated
// once so an upgrade doesn't silently reset anyone's dark/light preference.
// cockpit-theme-overhaul: grew again to 12 (the 2 original Helm palettes
// plus 5 real named families, each contributing a light+dark pair) and gave
// `toggle()` family-aware pairing - see that method's own comment.

import AppKit

// Theme-audit task: every top-level window/view controller in this app must
// do all three of the following, or a view silently stops following the
// active Helm theme (the recurring bug class this task exists to close out -
// Hosts panel in PR #18, FleetController/PlaceholderViewController in PR
// #18's Fix 8, the icon rail here). When adding a new destination, sidebar,
// or sheet, check it against this list before shipping:
//   1. Register via `ThemeManager.shared.observe { ... }` in `loadView()` (or
//      `NSWindow.followHelmTheme()` for a bare window with no view-level
//      hook) - discard the returned token unless this view's lifetime is
//      shorter than the app's (see `ThemeObservation` below), in which case
//      keep it and call `ThemeManager.shared.unobserve` on teardown.
//   2. Force `root.appearance = NSAppearance(named: theme.mode == .dark ?
//      .darkAqua : .aqua)` inside that closure - otherwise any system-
//      semantic color used anywhere in the view's subtree (`.labelColor`,
//      `.secondaryLabelColor`, `.windowBackgroundColor`, etc.) resolves
//      against the OS's actual light/dark setting instead of the in-app
//      theme.
//      **A layer-colour self-test cannot catch a violation of this rule** -
//      the fills keep tracking the theme perfectly while the scrollers, field
//      editors and menus around them do not, which is exactly how Sticky
//      Board and Code Preview shipped half-themed with a green suite
//      (`fm/grandline-sticky-code-preview-polish`). Assert
//      `view.effectiveAppearance.bestMatch(from: [.aqua, .darkAqua])` against
//      the theme's mode instead. Do NOT use `NSVisualEffectView` +
//      `.behindWindow` blending for
//      a full-size destination or window's root: that material blends
//      against whatever is behind the *window* (desktop/other apps), not
//      other content inside it, and has been the direct cause of every
//      "renders in the wrong color" report so far (Hosts' Fix 6, this task's
//      icon-rail fix) - use a plain `NSView` with a `HelmTheme`-derived
//      `layer.backgroundColor` fill instead.
//   3. Actually repaint in that closure (re-set colors/backgrounds), not
//      just once in `loadView` - `observe` calls the closure immediately on
//      registration *and* on every later change, so as long as the same
//      code path handles both there is nothing else to do for live updates.
//   4. **Populate anything that closure iterates BEFORE registering it, or
//      end `loadView` with an explicit `applyTheme(ThemeManager.shared.
//      theme)`.** `observe` firing synchronously at registration is the
//      point of rule 3, but it is also a trap: a closure that loops over a
//      collection (`sectionLabels`, `railDividers`, a `cardBackgrounds`
//      registry) sees that collection EMPTY on the first firing whenever the
//      views are built further down the same `loadView`. The loop is a
//      silent no-op, those views keep whatever color they were constructed
//      with (usually a system semantic color, which is both off-palette and
//      often the wrong side of light/dark), and then the whole thing
//      self-heals on the next unrelated theme switch - so a theme-sweep
//      verification pass cannot catch it, only a first-load measurement can.
//      This has now been confirmed FOUR times in this codebase and is the
//      single most repeated bug class here:
//        - `IconRailController.restyleMark` (needed a second `restyle` call
//          at the end of `loadView`, since `mark`'s layer did not exist yet);
//        - `IconRailController.restyleDividers` (`railDividers` held exactly
//          one of its twelve dividers on the first synchronous run);
//        - `ShiftTaskEditorController` (`sectionLabels` empty, so the four
//          DETAILS/TAGS/DESCRIPTION/ATTACHMENT kickers rendered in
//          `.labelColor` - *brighter* than the body text they label - until
//          any theme switch fixed them; audit §5.1,
//          `fm/grandline-design-audit-phase0`);
//        - `HelmFormSheet` (Phase 6). Structurally guaranteed for a shared
//          scaffold rather than merely likely: the sheet registers its
//          observation in `init`, and every row - and therefore every entry
//          in the registries that closure iterates - is added by the caller
//          afterwards, so the first firing ALWAYS finds them empty. Hence
//          `refreshTheme()`, which every editor's `loadView` ends with.
//      The re-apply is one line and costs nothing, so prefer it by default
//      in any `loadView` whose theme closure touches a collection or a view
//      built after the `observe` call.
