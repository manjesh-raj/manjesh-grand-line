// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// "Tools" (cockpit-tools-page-core), phase 1 of 3 of a captain-reviewed
// HTML mockup for everyday DevOps utilities. Nine genuinely functional
// tools: YAML validate/beautify, JSON validate/beautify, Base64
// encode/decode, JWT decode, a Unix timestamp converter, a Mergely-style
// diff (phase 2, cockpit-tools-page-diff), and - phase 3,
// cockpit-tools-page-specialist - a certificate inspector, a cron next-run
// explainer, and a Kubernetes resource-unit converter, closing out the
// originally-scoped three-phase Tools page. Each kind-specific tool's own
// UI/logic lives in `ToolInstance.swift`, not here - see that file's
// "MARK: Certificate"/"MARK: Cron"/"MARK: Resource units" sections for the
// three phase-3 tools, plus `CertInspector.swift`/`CronExplainer.swift`/
// `ResourceUnits.swift` for their pure logic.
//
// `fm/cockpit-tools-page-multi-session` merged before phase 3 landed and
// gave this page a tab strip
// mirroring Console's ([TabModel] + TabChipView, see ConsoleController.swift)
// so a captain can hold several independent instances of a tool open at
// once - three separate Diff sessions comparing different things, each with
// its own inputs/output. `ToolsController` now only owns the tab strip, the
// landing-grid "pick a tool to open" picker, and which tab's view is
// currently shown; each tab's actual tool logic lives in its own
// `ToolInstance` (see ToolInstance.swift) - the same split Console already
// has between `ConsoleController` (tab lifecycle/chrome) and `TabModel`
// (one tab's own state).
//
// The landing grid is reused as the tool picker for New (⌘T): it's shown
// whenever there are no tabs, or after clicking the tab bar's "+" - clicking
// a card there always opens a *new* tab of that kind (never re-selects an
// existing one), matching the literal "open a new browser tab" mental model
// the captain asked for. Duplicate (⌘D) copies the current tab's kind AND
// its current input content into a new tab (`ToolInstance.snapshotContent`/
// `restoreContent`). Close (⌘W) closes one tab; closing the last tab
// returns to the picker - Tools' equivalent of Console's "never leave the
// window empty" rule, since the picker (not a blank tool) is this page's
// natural empty state.
