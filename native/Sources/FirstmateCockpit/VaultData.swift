// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Data side of the "Vault" rail destination (fm/grandline-vault-tab). Follows
// this app's established pattern for embedding another system rather than
// reimplementing it (see `FleetData.swift`/`UpdatesData.swift`'s own header
// comments): every read or write goes through Automic Vault's real `av` CLI
// (https://github.com/automic-vault/automic-vault) via `Process`, exactly
// what a captain would type at a terminal - never the Keychain directly, and
// never a cached/logged secret value. `av list`/`av doctor --json` only ever
// return secret *names* and tool *metadata*, never secret material, so those
// are safe to run here like any other read-only check (mirrors
// `NotSyncedData.swift`'s `av hardeners --json` usage). `av save`/`av inject`
// are NOT run from here - see `VaultController`'s header for why those go
// through a real Console terminal tab instead.
//
// The `av` CLI itself is just another entry in `DependencyCatalog`
// (`UpdatesData.swift`, id "automic-vault") - install/update reuses
// `UpdatesSource.check`/`.update` on that exact item rather than a second
// brew-cask mechanism, per the task's explicit instruction to reuse the
// existing update mechanic.
