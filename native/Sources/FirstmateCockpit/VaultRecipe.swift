// Manjesh Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// "Backup the recipe, not the values" (fm/grandline-vault-recipe-backup): a
// literal "export my secrets" feature was already rejected earlier in this
// app's history (see `VaultController.swift`'s own header) as recreating the
// exact plaintext-exfiltration risk Automic Vault exists to prevent. What's
// safe and useful to back up is the *recipe* - which secrets were hardened,
// for which tools/launchers - pure configuration, never secret material.
//
// This file is pure logic (model + build + diff), no AppKit, no `Process` -
// see `VaultRecipeGit.swift` for the git/filesystem side.
//
// A real CLI-surface finding from building this, not an assumption: `av`
// (checked via `av --help`, `av doctor`, `av hardeners --json`, and the
// `automic-vault` README's own "Secret Gates"/"Access Levels" section) has NO
// command that reports a secret's or tool's configured Access Level
// (Approval Required / Read Only / ... / Full Access) or a captain's own
// per-Launcher override rules - those live only in the menu-bar app's own
// local state (confirmed by reading that app's source directly), never
// surfaced to the CLI. `av hardeners --json`'s `secret_gate.routes[].
// caller_identifiers` is a STATIC catalog value (the same for every install,
// e.g. gh's hardener always lists `["gh", "com.github.cli"]`) describing the
// built-in patched CLI's own identity, not a captain-configured Verified
// Launcher list - so it is not meaningfully more informative than `av doctor
// --json`'s own per-tool `commands` field, which this recipe already reuses.
// Given that, this recipe honestly records only what's genuinely exposed:
// saved secret *names* (`av list`) and per-tool hardened status + launcher
// command names (`av doctor --json`, already modeled as `VaultTool` in
// `VaultData.swift`) - never a fabricated access-level field.
