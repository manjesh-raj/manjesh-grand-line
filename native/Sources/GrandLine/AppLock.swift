// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// App-level password lock (fm/grandline-app-lock). Reuses the Vault tab's
// existing `av` integration for the password itself (see `VaultData.swift`'s
// "App-level password lock" section) - this file owns only the lock/unlock
// state machine and its two timers, never a secret value.
//
// Three lock triggers, one state machine:
//  - launch: the app delegate calls `lock(reason: .launch)` once, before the
//    window is ever shown.
//  - idle re-lock at 1 hour: `tick()` (driven by a repeating `Timer`) reads
//    system-wide idle time via `CGEventSource.secondsSinceLastEventType` -
//    the same mechanism a screensaver uses, no Accessibility permission
//    required (unlike a global `NSEvent` monitor) - and re-locks once it
//    crosses the threshold. This is system-wide idle time, not "this app's
//    own window was idle": the whole point of an idle re-lock is "no one has
//    touched this Mac in an hour," which holds regardless of which app was
//    frontmost.
//
//    `fm/grandline-lock-and-rail-fixes` fixed a severe live regression here:
//    the captain reported the app re-locking every 10-30s (this class's own
//    `pollInterval`) even during continuous active use. The threshold/poll
//    constants were already correct (3600/30, confirmed by the self-test
//    below, which passes both before and after this fix) - the bug was in
//    trusting `CGEventSource` as the *only* idle signal. Two changes: (1)
//    the state ID moved from `.combinedSessionState` to `.hidSystemState` -
//    the latter is the documented, canonical idiom for "seconds since any
//    real hardware input" (what every other idle-time recipe for this exact
//    API uses); `.combinedSessionState` additionally folds in "events posted
//    by the current process via a private event source," which is the wrong
//    signal for a system-wide idle check and, on this unsigned/ad-hoc-signed
//    dev build (see this file's own "Local signing setup" notes elsewhere in
//    this repo), was the more plausible one to behave inconsistently. (2) a
//    local `NSEvent` monitor (`localActivityMonitor`, needs no Accessibility
//    permission since it only observes events already targeted at this
//    app's own windows) independently stamps `lastLocalActivityAt` on every
//    mouse/keyboard/scroll event this app receives - `tick()` now uses
//    `min(systemIdleSeconds(), secondsSinceLocalActivity())` as the idle
//    reading, so a captain who is demonstrably, continuously interacting
//    with this app's own UI can never be misread as idle no matter what a
//    single system-wide counter reports on a given machine. Genuine
//    inactivity (the captain away from the Mac entirely) still locks
//    correctly, since both signals then grow stale together.
//  - hard logout at 12 hours since the *last successful unlock* (not since
//    launch - re-derived from the brief's own example: unlocking at hour 11
//    resets the clock from there, it doesn't still hit a wall at hour 12
//    from launch): `tick()` also checks `Date().timeIntervalSince(lastUnlockAt)`
//    and, if that's crossed, locks with `.sessionExpired` instead of `.idle`
//    regardless of recent activity - the hard-logout check runs first each
//    tick so a captain who is actively idle-adjacent at the 12h mark still
//    gets the "session expired" message, not the ordinary idle one.
//
// `lastUnlockAt` is in-memory only, not persisted across a relaunch - a
// relaunch already always re-locks via the `.launch` trigger regardless
// (`AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching`), so there is no window where
// skipping persistence would let content through unlocked.
//
// Every threshold and the poll interval are overridable via env vars purely
// for live verification (see this file's own test pass) - never read from
// `AppSettings`/UserDefaults, so there is no way to configure a longer idle
// window from inside the (locked) app itself.
