// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-11 (production-readiness review, section 20): before this file, all
// production logging in ~80k lines of Swift was seven `NSLog` calls and a
// handful of stray `print`s. There was no `os.Logger`/`os_log` anywhere, and
// the dominant error-handling shape was `catch { return nil }` - so when the
// Overview PR list came back empty, "gh isn't installed", "the JSON was
// malformed" and "the network is down" were literally indistinguishable, and
// when the 15-minute background poller wedged, notifications went stale
// forever with no signal to anyone.
//
// This is the one logging surface. Two rules, both of which the review's
// section 20 asks for explicitly:
//
//  1. **Every catch-and-degrade site logs the underlying error before it
//     degrades.** Degrading quietly is what made the failures above
//     invisible; degrading loudly is still degrading, and costs nothing.
//  2. **Nothing here leaves the machine.** `os.Logger` writes to the local
//     unified log, readable in Console.app or `log show`. There is no
//     telemetry in this app and this file does not introduce any - which is
//     also why every message is `public` rather than redacted-by-default:
//     these logs are for the one person who owns the machine.
//
// On secrets: this app's own convention is that a secret never reaches a log
// (swept and verified during the review). `os.Logger`'s default string
// interpolation privacy is `.private` in the unified log, but do not rely on
// that as a redaction mechanism - the rule is still "don't log the value",
// exactly as it was before. Where a value is genuinely sensitive and still
// worth logging *something* about, log its shape (a kind, a length, a
// fingerprint), the way `LogRedactor` already does.
//
// Category names are the review's own list: subprocess runs, pollers, git
// sync, keychain, stores. Two more (`ui`, `ai`) exist because they carry real
// failure paths that would otherwise land in the wrong bucket.
