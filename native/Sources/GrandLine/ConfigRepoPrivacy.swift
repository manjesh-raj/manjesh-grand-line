// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-22: assert that the repo this app pushes to is private, instead of
// assuming it.
//
// What actually goes to `DotfilesSource.cloneURL` (`manjesh-config`): personal
// tasks and their attached screenshots (`ShiftGitSync`), runbooks and
// postmortems (`DocsRunbookGitSync`), the vault *recipe* - i.e. the list of
// secret names (`VaultRecipeGit`), and `.glbackup` bundles carrying the full
// host inventory and SSH key metadata including fingerprints
// (`GitHubBackupSource`). None of that is a secret *value*, and the review
// verified the repo was private on 2026-08-22 - but "private" was a standing
// assumption with nothing in the app checking it. A visibility flip (a
// mis-click in GitHub's settings, a repo transfer, an org policy change) would
// publish a bastion inventory and a task history silently.
//
// Design decisions worth not re-litigating:
//
//  - **`.unknown` never blocks a push.** No `gh`, no network, a rate limit, a
//    token without repo scope - all of those are ordinary and must not stop the
//    captain's tasks from syncing. Only a *confirmed* `"private": false`
//    refuses. A check that fails closed would make this app unusable offline,
//    which is a far more likely daily event than a visibility flip.
//  - **Cached for the process's lifetime once confirmed private.** The
//    alternative is a `gh api` round trip before every debounced Shift commit,
//    i.e. every few seconds of typing. A flip mid-session is caught on the next
//    launch; a flip is not something that happens while the app is open.
//    A confirmed-public result is *not* cached as final - it is re-checked, so
//    fixing the visibility and continuing to work does not need a relaunch.
//  - **Uses `gh` rather than an unauthenticated request.** A private repo
//    returns 404 to an anonymous caller, which is indistinguishable from "no
//    such repo" - exactly the wrong way round for a check whose whole job is
//    telling private from public.
