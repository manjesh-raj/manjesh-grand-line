// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// "GitHub Sync" (fm/grandline-setup-github-sync) - the data side. The captain
// maintains several personal GitHub repos that are forks of upstream tools he
// depends on; this pulls the latest upstream changes into each fork from
// inside the app, rather than by hand per repo. Mirrors `UpdatesData.swift`'s
// own shape exactly (a `check`/`sync` pair returning a status + a captain-
// visible detail string + the real command's raw log, never a fabricated
// result) and `VaultData.swift`'s "own purpose-built run/resolveExecutable/
// RunResult trio" convention (`UpdatesData.swift:133-180`,
// `VaultData.swift:347-410`) - consolidating this app's now sixth near-
// duplicate copy of that helper is still out of scope, per this project's
// AGENTS.md.
//
// Two real GitHub CLI operations, never a hand-rolled fetch/merge/push, for a
// repo GitHub itself does record as a real fork:
//   - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}` + `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/...`
//     to read the fork's real live fork/parent status and how far behind (or
//     diverged from) upstream it is - never a cached guess.
//   - `gh repo sync {owner}/{repo}` (source defaults to the repo's real
//     parent) to actually sync - fast-forwards the fork's default branch to
//     match upstream, and refuses (nonzero exit, "can't sync because there
//     are diverging changes; use `--force` to overwrite the destination
//     branch" on stderr - confirmed by inspecting the real `gh` binary's own
//     embedded strings, `github.com/cli/cli/v2/pkg/cmd/repo/sync`) rather than
//     silently overwriting real diverged work. `--force` is never passed by
//     this file, anywhere, under any condition - see `syncFork(_:)` below.
//
// `fm/grandline-github-sync-manual-upstream` added a second path for a repo
// GitHub does NOT record as a real fork but the captain still wants tracked
// against a real upstream - `automic-vault` (a private mirror the captain
// pushed by hand, not a GitHub-forked copy - `fork: false`, confirmed live).
// `gh api .../compare` only works within a real GitHub fork network - a cross
// repo compare between two repos with no recorded fork relationship 404s
// (confirmed live: `gh api repos/manjesh-raj/automic-vault/compare/
// manjesh-raj:main...automic-vault:main` -> 404 "Not Found", even though both
// repos share real git history). So a repo with `manualUpstreamOwner`/`Name`
// set (`GitHubSyncRepoConfig.manualUpstreamFullName`) goes through
// `checkManual(_:upstreamFullName:)`/`syncManual(_:upstreamFullName:)`
// instead - a small local scratch git clone (`localCloneDir(for:)`, never the
// captain's own working copy of the repo) used only to run the equivalent
// real git operations by hand: `git remote add/set-url upstream`, `git fetch`
// both sides, `git rev-list --left-right --count` for the real ahead/behind
// counts (the exact same semantics as `compare`'s `ahead_by`/`behind_by`,
// just computed locally instead of via GitHub's API), then - only when
// genuinely a clean fast-forward - `git checkout -B <branch> origin/<branch>`
// + `git merge --ff-only upstream/<branch>` + `git push origin <branch>`.
// `--force`/`--rebase`/`-X ours`/`-X theirs` are never used here either, for
// the identical reason `syncFork(_:)` never uses `gh repo sync --force`: a
// repo with real local-only commits must be refused, never overwritten.
