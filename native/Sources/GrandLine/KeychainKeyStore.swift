// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Secret storage for SSH key material. Phase 2 of the connection-manager work
// (design report `data/cockpit-ssh-manager-research/report.md`, Section C3 -
// "the part not to hand-wave"). Everything here is `Security.framework`
// (`SecItemAdd` / `SecItemCopyMatching` / `SecItemDelete`); there is no
// hand-rolled crypto and no plaintext file - the report is explicit that a
// plaintext-creds pattern (`backend/auth.py`) is "not acceptable" for private
// keys.
//
// Two Keychain items per saved key, both generic passwords scoped to this
// app's service name:
//   "<id>.key"  - the private key blob, exactly as generated or imported
//                 (still passphrase-encrypted if it was).
//   "<id>.pass" - the passphrase, only written when one was given.
//
// Items are stored with plain `kSecAttrAccessible` (unlocked, this device
// only) rather than a `SecAccessControl` ACL. That is a deliberate change
// from the original design (which asked the OS to also gate reads on a fresh
// biometric/passcode challenge): on this CLT-only, ad-hoc-signed build
// (`swift build`/`swift run`, no Developer ID - `codesign -dv` on the built
// binary shows `TeamIdentifier=not set`), `SecItemAdd` with ANY
// `kSecAttrAccessControl` fails `errSecMissingEntitlement` ("A required
// entitlement isn't present"), even with no access group and empty
// `SecAccessControlCreateFlags` - confirmed with a standalone probe outside
// this app, see the PR description. Signing ad-hoc with an explicit
// `keychain-access-groups` entitlement doesn't help either: without a real
// provisioning profile the process is killed outright before it runs at all.
// Both dead ends were verified experimentally, not assumed.
//
// So the Touch ID / passcode challenge in `authenticate(context:)` below is
// enforced by this app calling `LAContext.evaluatePolicy` itself, before the
// (now ACL-free) keychain read - same user-facing gate ("unlock this key"),
// without depending on an entitlement this build cannot hold. Naming the
// tradeoff plainly: the OS no longer refuses the raw keychain read to an
// unauthenticated caller at the ACL layer, only this app's own code path is
// gated. Revisit once the app has a stable signing identity (Phase 4
// packaging) - a real Team ID should let `kSecAttrAccessControl` work again,
// at which point the app-level gate can go back to being OS-enforced.
//
// Known limitation, stated plainly rather than papered over: this target is
// unsigned (Command Line Tools only, `swift build` / `swift run`, no
// Developer ID). An unsigned binary has no stable code-signing identity, so
// macOS may treat each rebuild as a "different app" for Keychain purposes -
// in practice this can mean an extra "<app> wants to use your confidential
// information" prompt after a rebuild, or in rarer cases a rebuilt binary
// being unable to re-read an item an earlier build wrote. This is inherent to
// the CLT-only dev workflow, not a flaw in the storage design, and resolves
// once the app is signed with a stable identity (Phase 4 packaging).
