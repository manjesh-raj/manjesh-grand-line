// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// SRE Lead's four-state phase, and how the toolbar control that shows it
// looks in each state.
//
// **This file used to be `SRELeadStatusPill.swift`, and the control it
// described no longer exists.** That was a bespoke `NSView` drawing its own
// rounded border, a 6pt `CALayer` dot and a label - written before this app
// had a design system, and never migrated by the phase that unified the very
// toolbar it sits in. Phase 7 (`fm/grandline-design-system-phase7`) gave
// Find, Compose, Blocks and Claude usage the shared
// `HelmPageToolbar.labeledButton` recipe (a bordered `.secondary` glyph plus
// label), and `labeledButton`'s own doc comment names "SRE Lead" as one of
// the four controls the audit prototype shows that way - but this control was
// not one of the sites it changed. So the toolbar shipped three labelled icon
// buttons and, first in the same row, a grey dot: the captain's
// `03-sre-lead-icon-live.png` against the proposed
// `02-sre-lead-icon-proposed.png`.
//
// `ConsoleController` now builds it with `makeLabeledButton` like every
// sibling, so there is no second toolbar-control implementation to keep in
// step. What the dot's colour used to carry, `HelmButton.tint` carries -
// a `HelmTint` case, resolved per theme and contrast-corrected by
// `HelmButton` itself, never a raw hue used as a label colour (Phase 0's
// rule). Click behaviour, the label text per state, the tooltip and the
// 5-tab concurrent-cap messaging are all unchanged.

    /// palette whose green is already dark, the corrected `.good` label sits
    /// close to plain ink. Seen in a real render: gruvbox-light's `.ready`
