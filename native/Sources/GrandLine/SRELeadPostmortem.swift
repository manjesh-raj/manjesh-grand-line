// "Generate Postmortem" (phase 2 of "Knowledge and speed",
// fm/grandline-sre-lead-postmortem): summarizes a completed SRE Lead
// investigation (the pane's own question/answer transcript - see
// `SRELeadChatView.transcriptForPostmortem`) into a structured markdown
// postmortem via one non-interactive `claude -p ... --output-format json`
// call, saved into the same `GrandLineDocs/runbooks/postmortems/` store
// phase 1 already built (`DocsRunbookStore.createPostmortem`).
//
// This mirrors `DictationCleanup.swift`'s exact `Process`/argument/parsing
// shape (see that file's own header for the full reasoning: `json` over
// `stream-json` since only the final reply text is ever needed, `/dev/null`
// stdin to skip `claude -p`'s ~3s piped-stdin probe, draining both pipes
// before `waitUntilExit()` to avoid a full-buffer deadlock) - not
// `SRELeadRunner`'s own multi-turn `--resume` pattern, since this is a
// single, stateless one-shot summarization with no follow-up turns needed
// and no MCP tool/persona/`--allowedTools` involved. `SRELead.resolveClaude()`
// is reused as-is, exactly like `DictationCleanup` already does.
//
// A `claude -p` failure here (no network, not authenticated, `claude` not on
// PATH, a bad/garbled response, a timeout) never loses or discards the
// original investigation transcript - `ConsoleController.generatePostmortemClicked`
// is the one call site, and it only ever appends an error message to the
// existing chat feed on failure; the transcript itself lives in
// `SRELeadChatView.messages`, untouched either way, so the captain can retry
// with no data lost.

        You are writing a postmortem document from a completed SRE Lead investigation transcript for the host "\(hostLabel)". The transcript is a real back-and-forth between the captain and SRE Lead, an assistant with exactly one tool - a read-only kubectl command run in the captain's own terminal - investigating this Kubernetes cluster.

        Write a structured postmortem in Markdown with exactly these sections, in this order:

        # <a short, specific title for what was investigated - this becomes the document's title>

        ## Timeline
        A chronological account of what was checked and found, as a `-` bullet list - one bullet per meaningful step or finding, not a copy of the raw transcript.

        ## Root Cause
        **Finding:** the root cause or best-supported conclusion from the investigation, one to a few sentences, with only the minimum supporting evidence needed to back it. If the investigation was inconclusive, say so plainly and state what it points to instead.

        ## Follow-ups
        **Recommended next action:** one or more concrete next steps, as a `-` bullet list if there is more than one. Omit this whole section only when the investigation reached no actionable follow-up at all.

        Base every claim only on the transcript below - do not invent facts, commands, findings, or output that isn't actually there. Reply with ONLY the markdown document itself - no preamble, no code fences, no commentary before or after it.

        Transcript:
