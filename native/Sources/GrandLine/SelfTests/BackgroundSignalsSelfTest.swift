// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-29: permanent coverage for `BackgroundSignalsPoller`'s pass latch and for
// `ServiceHealthRegistry`'s verdict/threshold logic.
//
// Why the latch specifically. GL-03's shipped bug was that `isChecking` was a
// one-way door: one hung child process meant every later tick returned on
// `guard !isChecking`, and four of the Notification Center's nine signals went
// dark for the rest of the session with nothing anywhere saying so. Phase 2
// fixed it with a wall-clock watchdog and a pass id - and neither could be
// tested, because the decision was three inline lines wrapped around sixty
// subprocesses. `admit`/`mayReleaseLatch` are that decision, lifted out.
//
// Why the health registry. It is what turns a repeated failure into something
// the captain sees, and `failureThreshold` is the whole difference between
// "the network blipped once" and "this gauge is broken" - so the counter
// resetting on success is load-bearing, not incidental.
//
// Run: `FM_RUN_BACKGROUND_SIGNALS_TESTS=1 .build/debug/GrandLine`
//
// Nothing here spawns a subprocess or touches the network. The registry cases
// use a service case that no shipping code reports into during a headless run,
// so they cannot race a real reporter.

// GL-27: compiled into debug builds only.
//
// The 51 self-test suites are ~10,500 lines of test code, fault-injection
// seams and fixture data that used to be linked into the binary the captain
// actually runs. `FM_SELFTESTS` is defined by `Package.swift` for the debug
// configuration only, so `swift build` (and therefore CI and
// `Scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) still has every suite, while
// `swift build -c release` - what `native/build_native_app.sh` assembles the
// shipped `.app` from - has none of it.
//
// Do not remove this guard when editing a suite: `Phase3PolishSelfTest`
// asserts that every file in this directory carries it.
