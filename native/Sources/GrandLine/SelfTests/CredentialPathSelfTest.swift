// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-29: permanent coverage for the SSH credential path - `SSHKeyGenerator`,
// `SSHKeyMaterializer`, and the Keychain contract they sit on.
//
// This is the most security-relevant untested code in the app, and it had
// exactly one assertion anywhere before this: `Phase2HardeningSelfTest` drives
// `KeychainKeyStore.classify` for the Touch-ID-cancel decision. Everything
// else - key generation, PEM/OpenSSH import validation, `.ppk` refusal, the
// permissions on the one file private key bytes are ever written to, and the
// promise that `materialize` never runs on the main thread - was verified only
// by hand, once, at the time it was written.
//
// Run: `FM_RUN_CREDENTIAL_PATH_TESTS=1 .build/debug/GrandLine`
//
// What this does and does not touch:
//
//   - It runs the real `/usr/bin/ssh-keygen` and writes to real scratch
//     directories under the system temp dir, because the whole point is that
//     the argv this app builds actually works. Every key it generates is
//     thrown away in the same run.
//   - It does **not** write to the login Keychain (that is what
//     `FM_RUN_VAULT_DATA_TESTS` already accepts the cost of, and it is the one
//     suite CI skips for exactly that reason), and it never touches
//     `SSHKeyStore`'s real `keys.json`. The Keychain half is covered by
//     asserting the *contract* - `authenticate`'s off-main precondition and
//     `classify`'s cancel mapping - rather than by prompting for Touch ID in a
//     headless run, which cannot be answered.

// GL-27: compiled into debug builds only.
//
// The 51 self-test suites are ~10,500 lines of test code, fault-injection
// seams and fixture data that used to be linked into the binary the captain
// actually runs. `FM_SELFTESTS` is defined by `Package.swift` for the debug
// configuration only, so `swift build` (and therefore CI and
// `Scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) still has every suite, while
// `swift build -c release` - what `native/build_native_app.sh` assembles the
// shipped `.app` from - has none of it.
//
// Do not remove this guard when editing a suite: `Phase3PolishSelfTest`
// asserts that every file in this directory carries it.
