// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// GL-29: permanent coverage for `FleetDataSource` and `OpenPRsSource` - the
// pair that drives Overview and Review, and therefore the app's answer to
// "should I act right now."
//
// What is covered here is deliberately the *decision* logic, not the network:
//
//   - `mergedPRs`: how a forge-discovered PR and a task-tracked PR for the
//     same URL become one row, and which fields survive that merge. This is
//     where `taskID` comes from, and `taskID` is what makes the Merge action
//     possible at all (GL-38, fixed in Phase 2) - so a regression here breaks
//     merging without breaking anything visible.
//   - `canMerge`/`mergeArguments`: the Merge button's gate and the exact argv
//     `bin/fm-pr-merge.sh` is invoked with. GL-38 shipped for its whole life
//     with the task id missing from that argv and nothing noticed, because
//     nothing asserted the shape.
//   - `parseRemote`: every PR the app shows depends on turning the captain's
//     real `origin` URLs into `(forge, owner, repo)`.
//   - `classify`: which crew states read as "needs your call".
//   - `FetchResult.isDegraded`: GL-14's rule that a failed scan must never
//     render as an all-clear.
//
// Run: `FM_RUN_FLEET_DATA_TESTS=1 .build/debug/GrandLine`
//
// No `gh`, no `git`, no network, and no read of the captain's real `$FM_HOME`.

// GL-27: compiled into debug builds only.
//
// The 51 self-test suites are ~10,500 lines of test code, fault-injection
// seams and fixture data that used to be linked into the binary the captain
// actually runs. `FM_SELFTESTS` is defined by `Package.swift` for the debug
// configuration only, so `swift build` (and therefore CI and
// `Scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) still has every suite, while
// `swift build -c release` - what `native/build_native_app.sh` assembles the
// shipped `.app` from - has none of it.
//
// Do not remove this guard when editing a suite: `Phase3PolishSelfTest`
// asserts that every file in this directory carries it.
