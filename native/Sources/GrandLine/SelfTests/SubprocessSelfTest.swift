// Grand Line - native macOS app.

// `swift build && FM_RUN_SUBPROCESS_TESTS=1 .build/debug/GrandLine`
//
// GL-02's regression guard. The review asked for this suite by name: "ship
// with a self-test whose child floods stderr", because the stderr-flood case
// is the one that reads as already fixed. ~12 helpers in this app carried
// comments explicitly describing the pipe deadlock and a fix for it - and all
// twelve still deadlocked, because they drained stdout to EOF *first* and
// stderr only afterwards. A child that fills the 64KB stderr buffer while its
// stdout is still open wedges that thread permanently.
//
// So this suite does two things, not one:
//
//  1. It proves `Subprocess.run` handles the flood (both directions, plus a
//     discarded stderr and a stdout flood).
//  2. **It reproduces the old failure in-process**, with `legacyDrainOrderStillDeadlocks`
//     running the exact pre-fix sequence against the exact same child and
//     asserting it does *not* finish. That is what makes case 1 meaningful: a
//     passing flood test proves nothing unless the flood is genuinely capable
//     of deadlocking a reader. If that case ever starts "passing" (i.e. the
//     legacy order completes), the flood is no longer large enough to fill a
//     pipe buffer on this OS and the whole suite needs re-sizing rather than
//     trusting.
//
// Everything here uses `/bin/sh` + `yes` + `head`, which exist on any macOS
// including a bare CI runner - no python, no fixture files, no network.

// GL-27: compiled into debug builds only.
//
// The 51 self-test suites are ~10,500 lines of test code, fault-injection
// seams and fixture data that used to be linked into the binary the captain
// actually runs. `FM_SELFTESTS` is defined by `Package.swift` for the debug
// configuration only, so `swift build` (and therefore CI and
// `Scripts/run-all-tests.sh`) still has every suite, while
// `swift build -c release` - what `native/build_native_app.sh` assembles the
// shipped `.app` from - has none of it.
//
// Do not remove this guard when editing a suite: `Phase3PolishSelfTest`
// asserts that every file in this directory carries it.
