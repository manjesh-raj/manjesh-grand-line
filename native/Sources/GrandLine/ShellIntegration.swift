// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// `fm/cockpit-block-view-stage0`: the shell-integration hook that makes
// block view possible at all. SwiftTerm is a raw grid terminal emulator with
// no concept of "where a command starts" or "where its output ends" - that
// information only exists inside the shell itself. This hook is a small
// bash/zsh snippet, injected into an SSH host page's tab exactly the way
// `Host.startupSnippetID` already injects text into a freshly-connected tab
// (`ConsoleController.runStartupSnippet`) - same mechanism, not a new one -
// that makes the remote bash/zsh emit OSC 133 "semantic prompt" escape
// sequences (the same convention VS Code's and iTerm2's shell integration
// use) around every prompt cycle.
//
// Protocol actually used here (a deliberately narrowed subset of the full
// OSC 133 spec - see the reasoning below): two markers per prompt cycle,
// emitted once per shell round-trip, not four:
//
//   OSC 133;B BEL   - emitted from PS1, right at the point the prompt text
//                     ends and the cursor is ready for the captain to type.
//                     Marks the terminal-buffer row where the next block's
//                     raw content (the echoed command line, then its output)
//                     begins.
//   OSC 133;D;<exit-code>;<base64 command text>;<is-real 0|1> BEL
//                   - emitted from PROMPT_COMMAND (bash) / precmd_functions
//                     (zsh), i.e. right after a command finishes and before
//                     the next prompt is drawn. Carries the *exact* command
//                     text and exit code of the command that just finished,
//                     plus a fourth field (`fm/cockpit-fix-block-view-
//                     stage0-bugs`) distinguishing a real command close from
//                     a "nothing happened" one - see the `<is-real>` field
//                     note below, and `TerminalBlockTracker.closeBlock`'s doc
//                     comment for what the Swift side does with it.
//
// `<is-real>` and why D always fires, even for an empty Enter: PROMPT_COMMAND
// (bash) / precmd (zsh) run before *every* prompt redraw, including one
// triggered by pressing Enter on a blank line with nothing typed - bash does
// not add an empty line to history, so `history 1` (bash) / `$HISTCMD` (zsh)
// still returns the *previous* real command's text and number in that case.
// Before this field existed, that produced a real, reproduced bug: a
// captain hitting Enter on an empty prompt (a common habit) got a spurious
// extra block in the UI, labeled with the previous command's text, exit code
// preserved from before, and empty output (correctly empty, since nothing
// actually ran between the B and this D) - indistinguishable in the block
// list from a genuine repeat of that command. Each hook now remembers the
// history number/counter it saw at its last D (`$__fm_last_histnum`) and
// reports `<is-real>=0` when it's unchanged since last time - `D` is still
// sent unconditionally (never suppressed) so B/D stay strictly 1:1 and no
// block is ever left permanently stuck "running" because a blank-Enter's B
// had no matching D; `TerminalBlockTracker.closeBlock` discards (rather than
// finalizes) a `0`-flagged close instead of the shell skipping the marker.
//
// Known, deliberate residual gap, not fixed by this: a remote host whose
// dotfiles set `HISTCONTROL=ignoredups`/`ignoreboth` (or a matching
// `HISTIGNORE` pattern) suppresses the *history entry itself* for a command
// typed identically to the one right before it - so a genuine back-to-back
// repeat of the same command on such a host also reports `<is-real>=0` and
// its block is silently discarded, same as a blank Enter. Verified live
// (see this task's PR description for the pty-based repro/fix transcripts):
// with default `HISTCONTROL` (no dedup - what this app's own use of `ssh`
// starts with before any remote `.bashrc` runs, and the common case), a
// real back-to-back repeat still gets its own history number and therefore
// its own correctly-populated block. There is no signal available to
// PROMPT_COMMAND/precmd that distinguishes "the exact same command was
// re-typed and its history entry was deduped" from "nothing was typed at
// all" - both look identical (history unchanged) from here. A full fix
// would need a bash-preexec-style DEBUG-trap marker set *before* a command
// runs (this file's own header above already explains why that path was
// rejected: it mis-fires for a compound `PROMPT_COMMAND` string) - out of
// scope for this fix. Silently dropping the block (this fix's failure mode)
// was judged a smaller, more defensible gap than the always-reproducible
// "misleading empty block" bug it replaces: it fails toward showing nothing
// extra rather than showing something wrong.
//
// Why no separate "command executed" (C) marker, and why command text rides
// on D instead of being screen-scraped: a real preexec hook that fires
// exactly once per top-level command, with no false extra firings, is native
// in zsh (`preexec_functions`) but is a well-known minefield in bash, which
// has no native preexec - only a `trap ... DEBUG` hack. A first attempt at
// that DEBUG-trap version was built and tested live in the original task
// (see PR #79's description) and it mis-fired: bash's DEBUG trap also fires
// for each *sub-statement* of `PROMPT_COMMAND` itself when `PROMPT_COMMAND`
// is a compound `stmt1; stmt2` string (confirmed live: it double-fired on the
// first prompt and, worse, silently reported `false`'s exit code as 0
// instead of 1 once the guard logic got confused). Rather than reimplement
// bash-preexec's considerably more complex state machine just to get a `C`
// marker, this drops `C` entirely: bash's own `history 1` (and zsh's
// `fc -ln -1`) already give the *exact* text of the command that just
// finished, retrieved at PROMPT_COMMAND/precmd time - a strictly more
// reliable source than trying to screen-scrape the typed line back out of
// the terminal buffer. `TerminalBlockTracker` derives the *output* region
// from the buffer rows between a `B` and the following `D` (dropping the
// first captured row, which is the tail of the echoed command line) - see
// its own header comment for that half. This was verified live for both
// shells, including a non-zero exit command, with a scripted PTY session
// (see PR #79's description for the transcripts) before writing any Swift.
//
// Bash-version note: this uses only `PROMPT_COMMAND` + `PS1`, both present in
// even the ancient bash 3.2 macOS ships as `/bin/bash` - confirmed live on
// this machine. No `PS0`/`preexec_functions`-only feature is required. This
// also covers a remote bastion's bash/zsh, since the hook is sent as regular
// keystrokes over the already-established SSH session, not something local
// to this app's own process.
