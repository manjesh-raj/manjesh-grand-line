// Hand-rolled natural-language date/time detection for the New/Edit Task
// sheet's Title field (cockpit-shift-create-edit, phase 2). Per the brief:
// this doesn't need full natural-language coverage, just the common cases
// the reviewed mockup demonstrated - today/tomorrow/next-week/next-<weekday>/
// a bare time-of-day, and simple combinations of a day phrase plus a time.
// No third-party dependency - the recognized vocabulary is small and fixed,
// so a small hand-rolled scanner is simpler and more predictable than parsing
// with `NSDataDetector` (which is tuned for prose, not short task titles) or
// a general NLP library.
