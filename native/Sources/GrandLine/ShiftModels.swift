// Grand Line - native macOS app.
//
// Data model for "Shift" (cockpit-shift-foundation, phase 1 of a multi-phase
// build - see AGENTS.md's "Shift" section for the file-splitting scheme and
// which phases are still pending). These are plain Swift structs, not
// `Codable` against JSON - persistence goes through `ShiftYaml.swift`'s
// explicit `Yaml` conversions, since the source of truth is a captain-owned
// YAML file tree, not a database.
//
// The core distinction the captain was explicit about: a **task** is
// something to do; a **follow-up** is something to check on later. They are
// modeled as two separate types with different fields, not a shared "item"
// type with a "kind" flag - see `ShiftTask` vs `ShiftFollowUp` below.
