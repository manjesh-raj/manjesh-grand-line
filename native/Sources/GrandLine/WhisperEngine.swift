// Grand Line - native macOS app.

// Dictation's optional local Whisper engine (fm/grandline-dictation-whisper-
// engine) - a thin Swift wrapper around vendored whisper.cpp's plain C API
// (`Vendor/whisper.cpp`, see that directory's README.md for what was vendored
// and why). This is the low-level "run inference on a buffer of samples"
// piece; `WhisperModel.swift` owns downloading/locating the model file, and
// `DictationEngine.swift` decides when to use this instead of (or alongside)
// the Apple Speech framework path.
//
// `whisper_full` is not thread-safe for the same context (see whisper.h's own
// doc comment on it) - this wrapper does not add its own locking, since
// `DictationEngine` only ever calls it from one recording at a time (the
// hold-to-record gesture is inherently serial - the hotkey can't be "held"
// twice concurrently).
