# Vendored SwiftTerm (patched)

This is a vendored, patched copy of [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm)
`Sources/SwiftTerm`, pinned to upstream commit `dd2fb8ac5b861e7bf617c872895e338f38165648`
(tag `1.15.0`). It replaces the plain SPM remote dependency that `native/Package.swift`
used to declare.

## Why vendored instead of a remote SPM dependency

SGR-2 (dim/faint) terminal text was nearly invisible in light Helm themes: light gray
on near-white. The root cause is `NSColor.dimmedColor(towards:)` in
`Sources/SwiftTerm/Mac/MacExtensions.swift` (and the iOS twin in
`Sources/SwiftTerm/iOS/iOSExtensions.swift`), which blends the foreground 50% toward
the background in flat sRGB regardless of which side is dark. That fixed 50% blend
lands on a good contrast ratio when the background is dark (blending a light ink
toward near-black still leaves it far from the background) but collapses to well
under 2:1 when the background is light (blending a dark ink toward near-white pulls
it most of the way to invisible).

There is no public hook to override this: `dimmedColor`, `getAttributes`,
`buildAttributedString`, and `mapColor` are all `internal` methods inside
`extension TerminalView` (not `open`, not part of the module's public API), and
`TerminalView.draw(_:)` itself is `public` but not `open`, so it can't be overridden
from a subclass in another module either. Fixing this required patching the function
itself, so the dependency is vendored here rather than fetched from GitHub - this
keeps the patch entirely inside this repo (reviewable in a normal diff, no external
fork to maintain) instead of depending on a personal SwiftTerm fork.

## The patch

`dimmedColor(towards:)` (both the AppKit and UIKit variants) now targets a fixed
WCAG contrast ratio (4.5:1, matching this project's own `verify-contrast.mjs` bar)
against the background, found by bisecting the blend fraction along the straight
sRGB line from the foreground to the background, capped at the original 50% so dim
text never becomes *less* dimmed than before. On dark backgrounds the cap wins (the
old 50% blend already clears 4.5:1 by a wide margin, so behavior is unchanged). On
light backgrounds the bisection finds a smaller blend fraction that stays legible
instead of collapsing toward the background. See the doc comment on
`dimmedColor(towards:)` for the exact algorithm.

## Second patch: truecolor de-emphasised text (cockpit-native-fixes5)

The `dimmedColor` patch above only fires for the SGR-2 "faint" attribute. Some tools
render de-emphasised text a different way entirely: a literal 24-bit truecolor
foreground (`ESC[38;2;r;g;bm`) chosen with no idea what background it will ever
render against. Verified live against this exact codebase's own firstmate session
(`tmux capture-pane -e` on a running `claude` pane): Claude Code renders its own
de-emphasised status lines ("Searched for N files...", token/cost footers) as
`ESC[38;2;153;153;153m`, not SGR-2 dim. That gray measures ~6.7:1 against a
near-black dark-theme background (legible, the look the source app intended) but
only ~2.55:1 against a light theme's near-white background - `getAttributes`'s
`flags.contains(.dim)` branch never sees it, so the first patch has no effect on it.

`getAttributes` in `Apple/AppleTerminalView.swift` now also checks whether the raw
foreground (`attribute.fg`) is a `.trueColor` case; if so it calls
`NSColor.legibleColor(against:)` / `UIColor.legibleColor(against:)` (new methods,
`Mac/MacExtensions.swift` / `iOS/iOSExtensions.swift`), which remap the color only if
it doesn't already meet the background contrast floor. This intentionally applies to
*every* truecolor foreground, not just gray/muted-looking ones - there is no reliable
way to distinguish "this is ghost/status text" from "this is a genuine but
unfortunately-low-contrast color choice" from RGB bytes alone, and the remap is
self-gating (a no-op whenever contrast is already sufficient) and hue-preserving
(blends toward black or white, whichever the color is already closer to, so a
saturated color darkens/lightens rather than desaturating to gray). See
`Dimming.contrastFixBlendFraction`'s doc comment for the full algorithm, including
why the blend direction can't simply be inferred from which side of the background
the foreground currently sits on.

## Third patch: wrap redraw boundary (`fm/grandline-terminal-wrap-duplicate-char`)

A captain-reported bug: when a long line soft-wraps to a second visual row in a
Console tab, the wrapped continuation row can start with a stray extra character -
observed as a duplicate of the original line's own leading (colored) character, e.g.
a `git diff`-style `+` marker reappearing at the start of the wrapped row. Confirmed
by the reporting task to be width-dependent (present only when a wrap actually
occurs) and not specific to one Console tab (Shell and the Herdr mirror tab, which
share this same vendored `TerminalView`, both showed it).

**What this task's own investigation found, and what it didn't.** An extensive
battery of tests against `Terminal`/`Buffer` (live wrap during print, wrap that
triggers a `scroll()`, `reflowNarrower` at many widths and through repeated
narrower/wider round-trips, byte-by-byte feeding to rule out PTY chunking, and an
exact reconstruction of the reported line/column width) never produced a duplicated
character in the underlying buffer content - `getCharacter()` on every affected cell
was correct in every case tried. A real `TerminalView` instance's `buildAttributedString`
output and an actual rendered `CGImage` bitmap (via `cacheDisplay(in:to:)`) were also
checked and were clean. This rules out the `Buffer`/`Terminal` wrap and reflow logic
itself (`insertAsciiRun`, `insertCharacter`, `reflowNarrower`) as the source of
*content*-level duplication, and rules out a one-shot forced-fresh-redraw of the
final state as a way to see the bug.

**What `cacheDisplay(in:to:)` structurally cannot reveal** is a class of bug where the
underlying buffer content and a *fresh* full render are both correct, but a live
*incremental* (dirty-rect-only) redraw leaves stale pixels from a previous frame
sitting at a row's edge, because `cacheDisplay` always forces a full draw of the
requested rect - it never exercises AppKit's own "only redraw what was invalidated"
path where a staleness bug like this would actually live. Reading
`TerminalView.updateDisplay`'s invalidation-rect computation with that in mind found a
real, concrete asymmetry: when a redraw's dirty row range doesn't reach the last
visible row, the code already extends the invalidated rect down by one extra cell
("so the sub-cell remainder just below the band's bottom row - descenders / tall
unicode - is cleared too", per that code's own existing comment) - but there was no
symmetric extension *upward* for a range that doesn't start at the first visible row.
A wrap's continuation row is exactly this shape: freshly written into (via `_y += 1`
or a `scroll()`-supplied row), non-zero `rowStart` relative to the viewport, redrawn
without necessarily also touching the row above it. Without the upward extension, any
leftover pixels from whatever that row's `BufferLine` slot in the circular buffer
last displayed - plausible in a `git diff`-heavy session with many similarly-colored
`+` lines reusing scrollback slots as they scroll past - are never included in the
invalidated-and-cleared area when a later partial redraw only covers that one row.

The fix (`Apple/AppleTerminalView.swift`) extracts the whole invalidation-rect
computation out of `updateDisplay` into a pure, testable
`TerminalView.invalidationRegion(rowStart:rowEnd:terminalRows:frameWidth:frameHeight:cellHeight:)`,
and adds the missing symmetric case: when `rowStart > 0`, the region is extended
upward by one more cell, mirroring the existing downward extension exactly. The two
pre-existing behaviors (extend down when `rowEnd` isn't the last row; extend fully to
`y = 0` when it is) are unchanged - covered by
`native/Sources/FirstmateCockpit/TerminalWrapRedrawSelfTest.swift`
(`FM_RUN_TERMINAL_WRAP_REDRAW_TESTS=1`), which also covers the new upward extension
and the exact mid-screen wrap shape (`rowStart`/`rowEnd` both strictly interior) from
the captain's report.

**Be honest about what is and isn't proven here.** The self-test proves the geometry
fix is genuinely symmetric and doesn't regress the two behaviors that already existed.
It does not - and structurally cannot, being a pure function with no view/CGContext -
prove that this was *the* mechanism behind the captain's screenshot, since confirming
that would need a real on-screen window driving genuine incremental AppKit redraws
across multiple frames (this sandbox has no way to grant Screen Recording/Accessibility
permission, and `cacheDisplay` bypasses incremental drawing entirely - see this
project's own `AGENTS.md` "Verifying native UI bugs without a real screenshot"
convention for the general constraint). If the captain can still reproduce the
duplicated character after this fix ships, the next step should be a live, on-device
repro with real window resizes and real captured frames, not another headless attempt.

## Updating this vendored copy

If SwiftTerm's own `dimmedColor` is ever fixed upstream (or a future version adds a
public/open hook for it), prefer reverting to a plain remote SPM dependency in
`native/Package.swift` and deleting this directory over carrying the patch forward.
Otherwise, to pick up a newer upstream release: replace `Sources/SwiftTerm` with the
new version's tree, then re-apply all three patches - `dimmedColor` and
`legibleColor` (`Mac/MacExtensions.swift`, `iOS/iOSExtensions.swift`, `Dimming.swift`,
and the `getAttributes` call site in `Apple/AppleTerminalView.swift`) and the
`invalidationRegion` wrap-redraw-boundary fix in `updateDisplay`
(`Apple/AppleTerminalView.swift`).

## Fourth patch: display gating (`displaySuspended` / `displayIntervalNanos`)

`Mac/MacTerminalView.swift` declares two new public properties on
`TerminalView` and `Apple/AppleTerminalView.swift`'s `queuePendingDisplay()`
honours them. Nothing else changed.

**Why it has to be a patch.** A terminal attached to a busy live session (this
app's Herdr tab attaches firstmate's own session, which prints almost
continuously) parses every byte on the main thread and repaints at 60 Hz for as
long as the app is open. Measured on the captain's real instance: **~6-16% CPU
and 2.9% GPU sustained while the app was merely backgrounded**, top CPU
consumer machine-wide, and a 5-second `sample` put nearly all of the main
thread's busy time in `CA::Transaction commit -> NSViewBackingLayer display ->
TerminalView.draw(_:)`. That is not a SwiftTerm bug - it repaints when its
buffer changes, which is correct - but there is no way to say "stop painting
for now" from outside the module: `updateDisplay`, `queuePendingDisplay` and
`draw(_:)` are none of them `open`, and `TerminalView` cannot be subclassed
into that behaviour.

**What the patch does.** `queuePendingDisplay()` gains one early return
(`displaySuspended` -> remember the wanted pass in `suspendedDisplayPending`
and schedule nothing) and reads its throttle delay from
`displayIntervalNanos` instead of a hardcoded `fps60`. Clearing
`displaySuspended` flushes the deferred pass. The iOS path keeps the literal
60 Hz value verbatim (`#if os(macOS)`), so only the platform this app ships on
is affected.

**What it deliberately does not touch: the terminal model.** Every byte still
reaches the buffer through the ordinary feed path, so scrollback stays exact
and a resumed view is correct immediately - it never needs a reconnect or a
redraw request from the child. Only the *scheduling of painting* moves.

The policy (when to suspend, when to throttle) lives entirely in the app, on
`CockpitTerminalView.refreshDisplayGating()` - see its own doc comment. If
SwiftTerm is ever re-synced from upstream, re-applying this patch is two
hunks: the property block after `pendingDisplay` in `MacTerminalView.swift`,
and the early return plus `fpsDelay` source in `queuePendingDisplay()`.
