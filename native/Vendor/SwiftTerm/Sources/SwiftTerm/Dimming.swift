//  Added locally (Grand Line vendor patch) to fix SGR-2 (dim/faint)
//  text contrast on light backgrounds. See MacExtensions.swift's
//  `dimmedColor(towards:)` doc comment and Vendor/SwiftTerm/README.md for the
//  full writeup. Shared by both the AppKit (MacExtensions.swift) and UIKit
//  (iOSExtensions.swift) `dimmedColor` implementations so the two platforms
//  can't drift. Uses only `Double` (no CoreGraphics) since this file, like
//  Colors.swift, is also compiled on Linux/Windows.

    /// it is self-gating - a foreground that already meets the target returns a
    /// blend fraction of 0 (no visible change), which is what keeps normal bright
    /// truecolor text, and any color already legible on the active theme,
    /// untouched. Blending toward black/white also preserves hue (all channels
    /// scale together), so a genuinely-chosen but low-contrast color (e.g. a
    /// dusty diff-removal red, measured live at `38;2;220;90;90`) darkens or
    /// lightens rather than desaturating into gray.

    /// off-white foreground on a light-but-not-identical background): pushing
