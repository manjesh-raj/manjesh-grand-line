# Vendored YamlSwift

Source: [behrang/YamlSwift](https://github.com/behrang/YamlSwift), pinned to upstream `master`
commit `063286d0a66200b6ae0687c06914b19fe7c8dc83`. MIT licensed - see `LICENSE`.

## Why vendored, not a remote SPM dependency

This app deliberately has zero remote SPM dependencies (see `Vendor/SwiftTerm/README.md` for the
original reasoning) - `Package.resolved` doesn't exist. The Tools page's YAML validate/beautify
tool (cockpit-tools-page-core) needs a real YAML parser, not a hand-rolled one - a hand-rolled
subset was fine for the captain's original HTML mockup, but the whole point of this tool is that
the captain pastes real Kubernetes manifests into it, which use enough of the YAML spec (anchors,
multi-document `---` separators, block/flow scalars, folded strings) that a partial parser would
silently misparse or reject real input. YamlSwift is pure Swift (no C library, unlike Yams'
libyaml-backed alternative), small (~1,500 lines across 6 files), and MIT licensed - vendored here
verbatim, unmodified, the same way `Vendor/SwiftTerm` is vendored.

## What's used, and a real limitation worth knowing

`Yaml.load`/`Yaml.loadMultiple` (`Yaml.swift`) are what `ToolsController`'s YAML tool calls for
Validate and as the parse step of Beautify - `loadMultiple` is what makes multi-resource Kubernetes
manifests (documents separated by `---`) work correctly, not just a single top-level object.

There is no `save`/`dump` API upstream for producing YAML text back out of a parsed `Yaml` value -
`YamlBeautify.swift` (`native/Sources/GrandLine/`) has its own small serializer for that,
which is serialization of an already-correctly-parsed tree, not YAML parsing, so it doesn't
reintroduce the "hand-rolled parser" problem this vendoring was meant to avoid.

## Local patch: `YamlOrderedMap` (fm/cockpit-tools-yaml-order-perf-fix)

Upstream `Yaml.dictionary` wraps a plain Swift `[Yaml: Yaml]`, which has no defined iteration
order. This used to be treated as a deliberate, documented trade-off ("beautify sorts keys
alphabetically for deterministic output, like `JSONSerialization.WritingOptions.sortedKeys` does
for the JSON tool") - but a real captain manifest (~35 Kubernetes Deployments, each with 10 keys
in a specific, meaningful order) showed this is a real data-fidelity bug, not a style choice: YAML
mapping key order carries meaning to a human reader, and Beautify was silently destroying it at
every nesting level, including the top-level document keys.

The fix is `YAMLOrderedMap.swift`, a new file (not present upstream) defining `YamlOrderedMap`: an
insertion-order-preserving map (a real dictionary for O(1) lookup, plus a parallel `keys` array)
that replaces `[Yaml: Yaml]` as `Yaml.dictionary`'s associated value everywhere - the enum case
itself (`Yaml.swift`), its subscript/`ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral`/`dictionary` property, and
every block/flow-map parsing accumulator in `YAMLParser.swift` (`parseBlockMap`, `parseFlowMap`,
`parseQuestionMarkkeyValue`, `parseStringKeyValue`, `putToMap`, `checkKeyUniqueness`). The parser
already builds each mapping key-by-key in source order during recursive descent - the bug was
purely that the *accumulator type* it folded those keys into had no memory of that order once
folded. `YamlBeautify.swift` now walks `dict.pairs` (insertion order) instead of sorting `dict.keys`.

## Re-syncing

If YamlSwift is ever updated, re-fetch `Sources/Yaml/*.swift` (except the new, not-upstream
`YAMLOrderedMap.swift`) and `LICENSE` from the pinned commit (or a newer one) into this directory,
then re-apply the `YamlOrderedMap` patch above - it is not upstream and will not survive a raw
re-fetch, the same caveat SwiftTerm's vendoring documents for its own patches.
